use dirumpere with vocem, eto, as in Aen. 11. 377

For verba querar Postgate compares Ov. Met. 9. 304 verba querar,
and points out that Propertius frequently uses verba where one
would expect the particular kind* oi words—whether of y'oy, sorrow,
or otherwise—to be indicated. Most editors have adopted Passerat's
conjecture vera, which Palmer supports by 3. 6. 35
Quae tibi si vetis animis est questa puella.
But in that passage the whole point tums upon the truth of the
complaint made: here there is no questibn oi true or false, only oi
his persistence in his love. Catuli. 66. 18 also quoted is quite

to use os summoning witnesses.
