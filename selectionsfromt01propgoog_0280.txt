PROPERTIUS, 1. 22„ 5-10. 213

‘the cesting forth of my friend's body was athing thou didst endure‚’
i.e. as an indignity. This seems better than to suppose esse omitted.

8. solo. The expressionis peculiar: the pulvis is represented as
not covering the body with the solum, though both pulvis and solum
referto the same thing.

9. ceunomo adds nothing to the sense ofproxima, except to
detine it more closely. ‘Next to the plain below, and coming right
up to it.¹

10. unis, ‘soil’ In French the plural terres is used for a

II. 1.

It would appear from this poem that Maecenas had been exerting
his intluence with his protlgl, Propertius, to induce him to employ
his muse in the service of Augustus and his govemmeut. It has
been frequently pointed out with what consummate political tact
Maecenas turned to account his own undoubted literary testes in the
interests of his patron, with a view to reconciling the Roman world to
the govemment of its new master. The marvellous originality of this
idea, as well as its singular aud immense success, has perhaps been
less generally acknowledged. Having ascended to power by a short

aud abiding a captivity. The secret of this great achievemeut lies
in the fact that under the inspiration‚ aud through the help, of a
minister marvellously fitted to play such a part, Augustus succeeded
