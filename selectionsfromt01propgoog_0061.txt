liv INTRODUCTION

only as sar as 2. 1. 63. Its style of writing and abbre-
viations prove it to belong to 'the fourteenth century:
there are no intervals between the poems, but the initial
letters are distinguished, and there are titles on the margin.
Baehrens gives 1360 as its date.

G. or Codex Groninganus, so called because now at
Groningen, is of a small octavo size, and contains sorty-
six leaves. lt was written by an Italian in the fifteenth
century, and Professor Palmer, who has examined it, agrees
with Baehrens in pronouncing it ol no value. It has an
importance however in the history ol the text from the
fact that Lachmann considered it the best of all the MSS.
ol our poet, assigning to N. only the place next below it.
¹Worthy of mention also is

Per. or Codex Perusinus, which is in fact none
other than the Codex Cuicz'anus ol Scaliger, and which
was re·discovered by Professor Palmer in 1874 in the ι
library of Mr. H. Alan. lt was written at Perugia in
1467 by the poet Pacific-us Maximus, whence Mr. Palmer
has given it the name of Perusinus. He has given
a collation of it at the end of his edition, and attaches
some value to its readings. One reading at least has
been restored from it in this edition. Lastly may be
mentioned the

Codex Hamburgensis, now at Hamburg, a small
quarto, written in Italy at some period of the fifteenth
century. lt contains Catullus, Tibullus, and Propertius.
lt has been much corrected, but Hertzberg attaches
considerable weight to it, and M. Plessis considers it
scarcely inferior to the MSS. ol Baehrens. lt follows
mainly the authority ol F., and agrees generally with
N. ·Α. and F, though it sometimes agrees with D. and V.
It may be considered as one of the best ol the fisteenth
century MSS. ; Baehrens, while valuing it because tran-
scribed from F.-though not till after F. had suffered
corruption-does not distinguish it from the rest of the
