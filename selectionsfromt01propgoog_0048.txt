TO PROPERTIUS. xli

seventeenth year. We may thus suppose that he was
born not earlier than Β. c. 50, nor later than Β. e. 47, and
that he assumed the manly gown between the years lac.

In the first flush of youth, Propertius came across his
fate in the person os the famous Cynthia, at once his
inspiration and his bane. The main work of his life was
to record in passionate poetry the various phases of this.
attachment : and the ups and downs in his relations with
her are the chief landmarks in his biography. Out of the
total number of ninety-one poems which he has lett behind
him, no less than sixty‘ have relation to Cynthia: if we
can arrange these in chronological order, we have prac-
tically the story os his life. The latest oi the number are
the two last elegies of'Book 111, in which, with a hardness
and cruelty of tone almost amounting to brutality, he
renounces his love for her, and finally bids her adieu. In
the third line of poem 2 5, summing up the past, he says

Quinque tibi potui seruire fideliter annos.

‘For five years I was able to serve thee faithfully.'

The natural meaning of these words is that his whole
attachment for Cynthia had lasted sor five years: and
though it is possible, as Mr. Postgate thinks, that a tempo-
rary reconciliation may have taken place' after these words
were written, it is certain that these two elegies arethe
last oi which she was the theme. But before the final
rupture, there was a previous period of estrangement which
occurred in consequence of some quarrel between, the
lovers, the cause of which does not appear. Propertius puts

it thus, 3, 16.9

him by banishing him from her presence for a year.
Now is this year to be counted amongst the five years
