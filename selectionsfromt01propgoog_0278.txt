PROPERTIUS, Ι. Ι9., 24-26—22, 1-4. 211

‘as befits our friendship ;' ‘as is natural for you, being my fn'end, ’

to do.’ So the common phrase pro virili parte means ‘as befits a
man 3' ‘as aman should d0;' ‘to the utmost of his ability.’

semper should be taken with quam's. Postgate's references
¹(especially Virg. Aen. 1. 198) scarcely justify the extreme harshness
of taking the word with amicitia as if it were an adjective. .

3. He marks his birthplace by its neighbourhood to Perusia,
a town which had gained evil notoriety by the terrible soenes at·
tending its siege and capture by the army of Octavianus in lac, 41.
The consul, L. Antonius (brother of the Triumvir)‚ had declared
against him, and finding himself unable to keep the field, shut
himself up in that strongly posted town.

The Perusian War is always spoken of with horror by the Au·
gnstan poets. Its outbreak gave rise to a feeling of despair: it
seemed as if there was to be no end of civic discord. It was this
war which prompted Horace's most despondent utterances, Epod. '1'
and 16. Interesting memorials of the siege and sufferings attendant
upon it are preserved in the Museo Kireheriano at Rome, in the
shape of lesden and other bullets hurled from slings between the
combatants, some of them inscribed with insulting messages. The
mere name of the place calls up to Propertius' mind the notious of
Death and Discord. .

tombs of our countrymen at Perusia,’ or (a) ‘That Perusia in which
our country (i. e. our country's hopes) found a grave? In the former
case the expression is analogous to such phrases as finitenusque
tubae clangor, etc, so common in Lucretius. Line 4seems to suggest
the latter interpretation, and is well illustrated by Cat. 68. 89

3, 4 These lines exhibit stronglya characteristic of Propertian,
and indeed of all ancient, poetry. They are deeply pathetic; yet there
is not one word which of itself suggests feeling. The simple
external reality is put before us in all its hardness and coldness,
without one sostening touch ; but so truly is the description drawn,
that if we only fairly realise it, the appropriate feeling rises of itself, and
