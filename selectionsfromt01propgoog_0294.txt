PROPERTIUS, 11. 1., 75-783 11. a, 5—8. 227

dress was calculated more to set off the beauty of the figure as a
whole, than to call special attention to the faoe. Our word ⁴ figure'

is often so narrowed as to refer to the waist only; but no ancient
statuebas a slender waist, and the ankles of all the most celebrated
statues of Venus-as e. g. the Venus de Medici and the Venus of ’
the Capitol—have that robust healthy thickness about them which a
horse-fancier would describe by the word ⁶ gummy.'

longae mnus. A well-developed taperinghand, fitted to do
well its work in life; here again the ancients had no idea that a
woman’s hand was beautiful in proportion to its approximating to
the hand of a doll. Cp. 3. 7. 60

’ Attulimus longas iu freta v'estra manus.
In Catull. 44. a long hands are specially mentioned as an essential
to beauty.

incedit, used especially of the majestic walk of Juno, Virg.
Aen. 1. 46, in a passage probably imitated here by Propertius:

Ast ego quae Diuum imedo regina Iouisque
Et soror et coniux.

1ove dtm soror, lit. ‘worthy of Jove as his sister,' he.
worthy to be Jove's sister.

7. Aut oum rellan aperimur is wrongly explained by
Hertzberg as a kind of anacoluthon. The peculiarity of the con·
struction is that Pallas is placed by attraction inside the clause
dependent on cum instead of outside it. The meaning is ‘ she moves
a very Juno ora Pallas.' ‘she moves as a sister worthy of Jove, or as
Pallas ruben she walks before the altars! The change suggested to
ut cum is no improvement3 aut ut would make'the sense clear were
it not too violent a change. The difficulty is that the particle
of comparison is omitted: Propertius does not say ‘She moves as
Jnno or Pallas,’ but actually identifying Cynthia with the goddess
to whom, she is compared: ‘She walks a sister worthy of Juno or
Pallas when,’ etc.

7. Dulichiae. Dulichium was one of the group of islands
called Echinades, off the coast of Acamanta. Homer, 11.2.625,
speaks of ‘Dulichium and the sacred islands Echinae. which lie
beyond the sea, opposite to Etis? Strabo identifies Dulichium with
one of the islands called Dolicha (Δολίχα) in his day. The island
formed part of the kingdom of Ulysses, and was therefore probably
the seat of the worship of his special patroness Pallas.

8. lt is evident that at Dulichium the goddess was worshipped
inber martial character, and represented in complete warlike array,
with the aegis on her breast.
