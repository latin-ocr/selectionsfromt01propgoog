1. mous, in the Propontis, or Sea of Marmora,was originally
an island. Strabo 'speaks of its being connected with the mainland
by two bridges: and Plin. N. H. 5. 40. z says it was joined to the
mainland by Alexander. At the present day, the connection is
formed by a low nnrrow sandy isthmus about a mile long.

2. fluit Isthmos, therefore, probably refers to the unsubstantial
character of the connection : ‘where floats our Isthmus? Pinder thinks
the words may perhaps stand for aqua Isthmus praefluit, as if the
Isthmus could be said ‘to flow with the waters’ that pass it. This
seems farfetched. But it is just possible that Propertius uses Isthmus
to denote the channel which divided the island or peninsula from the
shore, in which casefluit would be quite regular. See below 21. 28.

3. A much-vexed line. The MSS. read Dindymus and iuventa
(inventa N.), whilst Cybele is variously written. Vossius con-
jectures' iuvenca, which is supported on the ground that a cow
frequently appears on the coins of Cyzicus. From the similarities
existing between Cybele, Isis, Io (who gave her name to the adjoin-
ing Bosphorus), it is supposed that Cybele may have been wor-
shipped at Cyzicus under the form of a cow. There was' a Mount
Dindymon, or Dindyma, at Cyzicus (Strabo ra. 8. 11) of the same
name as the more famous mountain near Pessinos, the chief seat of
Cybele's worship in Phrygia, from which she derived the name

tain itself will be intended; the construction must be either qua
Dindymus est, or else placuit must be supplied from l. 1. Either
construction is harsh; whence Palmer reads Dindymis, a similar
epithet to Horace's Dindymene. Dindymis, however, might also
stand for the town, as we leam from Plin. N. H. 5. 40. 1, who says
that Cyzicus was also called Dindymis, cuius a vertice mons Dindy-

Apoll. Rhod. 1. 1117 and Strabo 11. 8.11. Strabo speaks of a
temple of Cybele on Mount Dindymon above Cyzicus, founded by
the Argonauts; and Apollonius describes how Argus made a statue
of the goddess out of an old vine-stock, and set it upon a hill.
