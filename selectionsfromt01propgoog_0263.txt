196 NOTES.

Postgate declares this to bc not to the point, maintaining that Pro-
pertius means ‘I shall walk a god among the gods? The reference
to the gods is scarcely in place. and destroys the simple realism of
the idea. The plain meaning is, ‘I shall tread on the very stars as Ι
walk along‘ in triumph and exultation. Cat 66. 69 me nacte prc-
munt vestigia deum is scarcely in point. Berenice's hair, changed
into a star, says quite simply ‘the gods plant their steps on me,‘
‘I form the road over which they walk.’

licet. Postgate well points out in this and other passages, how
fond Propertius is of softening his meaning, so that he prefers to say
that he may, or that he will, or that he desires, or that he intends,
to do a thing, rather than that he actually does it. This tendency
he connects with irresolution and weakness of will, as characteristic
of the poet. See his Introduction. “

several of his most intimate pieces. Happy in the conscionsness of

Cynthia's love, he tells his friend that he has no envy of his beautiful
¹ villa on the Tiber, with its costly furnitnre and lovely view, for he
possessas in his love a joy and a wealth that far transcend all the
joys and wealth of kings. From the Sixth Elegy of the First Book
it appears that Tullus was the nephew of a man of distinction,
L. Vocatius Tullus, who was consul in the year iac. 33, along with ν
Octavian himself. This uncle, probably in the year 27 13.c., was
setting out as proconsul to the senatorial province of Asia, and
taking with him his nephew Tullus as his legatus. On that occasion
Tullus offered to find a place for the poet on his uncle’s staff: but
Propertius declared (1. 6) that he could not tear himself away from
