μὴ πτερύγων τρομέοι τις ἐπήλυσιν· ἐξότε γάρ μοι
λάξ ἐπιβὰς στέρνοις τιιιρὸν ἔπηξε πόδα,
ἀστεμφής, ἀδόνητος ἐνέξεται, οὐδὲ μετέστι,
εἷς ἐμὲ συζυγίην κειράμενος πτερύγων. χ
Here Love tramples on the lover’s breast, and, having lost his wings,
cannot fly away.

16. See note on 1. 6. .

17. siccin medullis. Love has drained him of his life
blood, either by the wounds of his arrows, or actually by drinking
it. Thus Theocr. Id. a. 55 represents Love as fastening like a leech

THE following elegy has an exordium of sixteen lines prefixed to
it in the MSS.. which Lachmann and other editors believe, without
sufficient reason, to have formed aseparate poem, Those lines
repeat the oft-told, well-wom theme that love for Cynthia is the

inspirer of the poet's muse ; and though lighter in tone than the
' succeeding verses, which deal with the poet's death and funeral, the
contrast is scarcely stronger than is to be found in other passages
His love for Cynthia is theone portal through which Propertius
approaches every subject; and we have seen elsewhere (especially
a: 1. 71-78) in how morbid (or shall we say puerile i) a fashion he
drags in the idea of his death whenever his love has met a check.
Our own Laurente has coupled ‘ Love aud Death ι’ Propertius con·
