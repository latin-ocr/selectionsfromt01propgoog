shows that there was some story, hitherto unexplained, about the
arms ¹of Polydamas which might explain Pulydamantis iu armis. ’
Simpler is Polydamanta sub armis, in which case Polydamas would
be mentioned merely as one of the Trojan warriors. That Polyda·
mantis in armis refers to Paris in l. 30 is unlikely, sor the reason
stated in l. 27.

30. Paris is reserved for the last, to complete the climax. Paris
himself, the faus et ongo of the whole 'lhojan disaster, would be un-
known to the soil of his own country, were it not sor the work of

'- poets.

qualemcunque, used absolutely, not relatively: ‘ol whatever
kind he was? Cp. Quint. 11. 1. 14 Hoc qualecunque discrimen raro
’ admodum eveniet.

31. Exiguo sermone. An extension, not uncommon, of the
ablative of quality to an absolutely external circumstance. Applied
to an individua] it would be natural enough, meaning ‘with small
powers of talk,' just as exiguo corpore would mean ‘with a small
body' (Nep. Ages. 8). The peculiarity here is that the remeo is not
that of Ilion, but of people obmu Ilion: in other words, Ilion is the·
object, not the mbjmt, of the talk.

32. No satisfactory distinction hasbeen establishedbetween
Ilion (erilium) and Troia. In Virg. Aen. 3. 3 both words are used
to deuote the town exclusively:

ceciditque mperbum
Ilium, et omnis humo fumat Neptunia Troia. s
acrasitanae. Hercules, so called because he erected his
funeral pyre on the top of Mouut Oeta. Troy was twice taken by
Hercules: once by himself, because Laomedon defrauded him of
his promised reward for saving his daughter Hesione from the sea·
monster; a second time because it was by his arrows, bequeathed to '
Philoctetes, tha Paris was wounded, aud the Greeks thus enabled
to take the city.

34. rasurarum, simply ‘in the after-time? Surelyuot, as Post·
,gate suggests, an ablative of the means, ‘through posthumous lapse
of time? Posterus is not equivalent to ‘posthumousz' postumus
itself does not necessarily, only by implication, mean ⁶ aster death ;'
aud posteritas means simply‘ subsequam-nese? Cp. Hor. Od. 3. 30.y
