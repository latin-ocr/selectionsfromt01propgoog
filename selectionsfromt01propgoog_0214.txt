‘The Genius was naturally believed to exercise an especial super-
intendence over wedlock3 the marriage bed was under his protection,
und was called geniales urus1, and the expression genialis praeda

· is appropriately applied by Ovid A. A. 1. 12 5 to the Sabine women,

whom the Romans had soreibly seired for their brides. Observe
also that genialis is used generally asan epithet for anything which
conduces to festivita mirth‚ or pleasure. Genialis dies is a day ol
joviality, Genialis hiems points out winter as the season of convi-
viality, expressions arising from the comfortable doctrine held by the
ancicuts, that in taking care of themselves, and looking after their
own enjoyments, they were performing an acceptable service to their·
Genius. Those who practised abstinenoe were said defraudare
Genium suum, Terent. Phorm. 1. 1. 9 belligerare cum Genia²;
while the precept of Persius, S. 5. 151 indulge Genio, is an exhor-
tation to eat, drink, and be merry. In like manner, as there were
public Lares and Penates, the whole Roman people‚ taken collectively,
was supposed to have a Genius. When we read in Livy ar. 62 that
the Genius was propitiated by the sacrifice of five full-grown victims,
we must understand the historian tomeun the Public Genius, to whom
we find votive tablets inscribed with the words GENIO. P. R. We
find similar tablets to the Genius ol an Army, of a Century, of a
Colony; nay more, places also had their Genius³, and Prudentius,

C. Symm. 2. 369, 444, twits his opponent with the fact, that walls, '

gates, baths, stables, all had their Genii, so that scarce n corner of
the city could be found without a god of its own. The Genius of a
place was represented by a snake, Servius, Virg. Aen. 5. 853 and
hence to paint a snake upon the walls of any place of public resort
was the method adopted to point out that it was sacred, and not to
be defiled, Pers. S. 1. 113. ·
- ‘Somewhat more mystical is the statement of Aufustius, an un-
known writer quoted by Festus ⁴, that the Genius is the son of the
gods, and the creator ol men (dearumfilius et parens bantinum), the
instrument, as it were, employed by the gods in the formation of men.
