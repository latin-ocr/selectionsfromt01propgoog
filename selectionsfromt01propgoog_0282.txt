PROPERTIUS,11.1., 1-6. 215

5. >The construction of sive, repeated in each couplet down to
.l. 16, is peculiar. The usual construction of sinc-sive, as of our
disjunctives ‘whether-or,’ is that each has a verb to itself in protasis,
while the apodosis consists of one single verb, which is applicable to
' both or more alternatives. Thus Plaut. Trin. 1. r. 146
seu recte scu perverse sacta sunt,
Egomet fecisse confiteor.
‘Whether it was well or badly done, I confess that 1 did it! In the
passage before us, each fresh alternative introduced by sinc has an
apodosis of its own, so that the sense is not represented by ‘whether
—or—-or,' but by ‘If—or if-if again,’ etc. See Ovid. Am. a. 7. 9
Sive benus color cst, in te quoquc frigidus esse,
Seu melus, altm'us dicor amore mori.
, In l. 15 again scu and sine are thrown in almost as snrplusage, add·
ing nothing to the sense, which is completely expressed hythe
mining-up words quidquid fecit, quodcumque est locuta. It is
impossible to translate seu and sive in that line, unless we allow
quidquid, quodcumque to lose their relative force l‘ whatsoever ’) and
simply stand for ‘anything at all! Α somewhat similar use of scu
occurs 4. a. 11, where it joins together two principal verbs, without
any subordinate verb:
Seu, quia vertentis fructum praecepimus anni,
Vertumni mersus creditur esse sacmm.
Here scu simply means ‘or else! An exactly similar example occurs

incedere, of the stately, majestic walk of a tall person, ora

and of Cynthia herself. 2. r. 6

coccis,aconjectureof Lachmann, can scarcely be right, forthough
Cynthia was doubtless fond of gay colours (see a. ²9· 26) a finite
verb is needed to go with sive, and it is too harsh to understand vidi
from l. 7. Some propose vidi, which would give a clumsy repe-
tition. Possibly cogis, read by some MSS„ may be right: but the
passage seems to require a verb in the first person. Lachmann alters
the order of the third, fourth, and fifth couplet, pntting them in this
order: five, four, three. In this way the reference to the lyre comes im-
mediately after that to Apollo and her ingenium iu the second couplet,
and vidi can be supplied readily in l. 5 if preceded by ll. 7, 8.
