cally in a wide sense at Rome, as ityincluded all citizens

liable to be called on for military service up to forty·six ’

years of age. Thus under the constitution of Servius
Tullius each Class was divided into an equal number of

Senior Centuries and Junior Centuries: all citizens up to
¹ the age of forty·six were included in the latter. The
language of poetry, however, was not bound to conform
to such a use as this3 and we may fairly assume that
' the sact of an early death would not have been insisted on
by Domitius had Tibullus been more than sorty when he
died. Assuming this point therefore as an extreme limit‚
we may assign Β. c. 59 as the earliest possible date for the

poet’s birth, whilst it is not possible for various reasons to Ι

place it later than B.C. 54. The latteris the date assumed by
Lachmann,thesormeristhatadoptedbyDissen3 andthough
it is impossible to arrive at a certain conclusion on the sub-
ject, Dissen holds that the earlier date fits in best with the
poet’s biography as a whole. It certainly suits well the

tone of Horace’s Epistle‚ in which he treats Tibullus as ’

an equal to whose criticisms he attaches weight‚ while at

the same time he addresses himin that patronising but
kindly tone which he could only have employed to one
decidedly younger than himself. Horace was born in
Β. c. 65.

The praenomen of our poet is unknown. Heswas a

Roman aquea, and was probably born at Pedum, a Latin ·

town just at the foot of the Apennines, and a few miles
north of Praeneste, where his father possessed an ample
estate. He had been brought up, he tells us (1.10. 16), on
this estate, and he had looked forward to inheriting a rich
patrimony; but his fortunes came under a cloud, and he
lost either the whole or the greater portion of it. The
· language which he uses upon the subject is ndt free from
ambiguity3 but it is certain that the losses which he sus-
tained were connected with his landed estate, and that
they were only of a partial character. He still continued
