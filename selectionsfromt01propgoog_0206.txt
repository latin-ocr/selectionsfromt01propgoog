ratae-tino is an adj„ ‘the Palestine Syrian! Note that the term
Syria was used in a loose sense by the Romans, being applied to the
whole country bordering the Ievaut from Cilicia to Egypt, and
stretching iuward to the Euphrates and Arabia.. Thus all Phoenicia
and Palestine were included within its limite.

Pigeons were sacred to the Syrien Goddess Astarte or Ash-
tareth, identified by the Greeks with Aphrodite.

20. Error, which became the chief city of Phoenicia alter the
decay of Sidon, is here put for the Phoenicians as a whole. As is
well known, they invented navigation, and for many centuries
monopolised the commerce not of the Mediterranean only, but of the
world.

oredere docta. This Graeciam-an infin. depending directly
upon an adjective or participle—is common in all the Augustan
poete, but especially in Horace. Cp. Od. 413. 7 doctae psallere
Chiae ; and Ib. 1. 1. 18 indocilis pauperiem pati. See below 1. 28.

21-26. We may here transcribe a passage from Heeren on the
ancient Egyptians: ‘The cause of the yearly inundations of the Nile
was an object of much research even in ancient times. Herodotus
formed many conjectures respecting it, and decided for the most
reasonable of them (Herod. 2. 20, etc). Agatharchides, however,
seems to have been the first to discover the truth (Agatharchid. ap.
Diodor. 1. p. 50). The constant rains, to which the districts of
Upper Ethiopia are subject during the xwet season, from May to
September, swell all the rivers iu those regions, the whole of which

Α pour their floods into the Nile, which consequently becomes the re·

servoir of this prodigious accumulatior of water. In the middle of
June, about the time of the summer solstice, the Nile begins to rise
in Egypt. It continues to increase till the end of Jnly, though still
confined within its channe13 but in the first half of August it over·
flows its banks inundates the neighbouring territory ², and its waters
continue, without intermission, to extend themselves till September.
About. this time, the torrents of rain in Ethiopia having ceased, the .
Nile begins gradually to fall, but so slowly, that the greater part of
the territory of Egypt remains covered with its waters till the com·
mencement of October; and it is not till towards the end of this
month that they completely return into their bed. The period of the
inundatiou, therefore, continues from the middle of August to the
end of October ; and during this time all the fertile valley of Egypt
