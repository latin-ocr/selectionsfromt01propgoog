3 56 NOTES.

This lepidus was consul sufficias uc. 34, and censor in rac. 22, in
which capacity he completed the famous Basilica Aemilia, of which
a portion, built of briclr, still survives as the front wall of the
Church of S. Adriano in the Forum. Cornelia left two sons and a
daughter. The elder son, Lucius, married his first cousin Julia,
grand-daughter of Augustus, and was consul in A.1>. 13 the younger,
Marcus, was consul in Μ), 6 with L. Arruntius, was employed in
important commanda by Augustus, and was named by him, shortly
before his death, as one of the three possible aspirants to the empire:
M. Lepidum dixerat capacem sed aspernantem, Gallum Asinium
avidum et minorem, L. Amantium nan indignum, et, si casus
daretur, ausurum Tae Ann. 1. 13.

Of the daughter Lepida nothing certain is lrnown. Cornelia her·
self died in the year A. D. 16, the year of her brother's consulship, as
we leam from l. 66.

The form of the poem is peculiar. Cornelia is supposed to atter
it after her death; hence she addresses alternately her husband as
to her past life, and the judges of the lower world as to her future.

Mr. H. A. J. Munro disputes the claim of this poem to be held not
only the noblestelegy of Propertius, but ‘the queen of all elegies,' as
it is held by some to be, and denies that it represents by any means
the poet’s very highest inspiration. I should be inclined to differ from
him. There is a noble stateliness, an uncoascious grandeur of self-
assertion, a true Roman strength in the way in which Cornelia
describes herself, her life, and her family, which enable us to form
a picture of the Roman matron such as can be gained from no other
source-except perhaps by contemplating the statues of the Vatican
-and which recall the words used by Aristotle of the μεγαλό-
ynxoawho ‘thinks himself worthy of great things, being worthy.'
And the simple pathos and delicacy of the conclusion are unexcelled
in literature.

1. urgere, of any human emotion, implies force and insistauce:

used similarly of the importuning of grief, Hor. Od. a. 9. 9
T u semper urges flebilibus modis
Mysten adeneplum.

In urgere sepulcrum, as so often in ancient poetry (and especially
throughout this poem), the simple physical idea is confused with,
and held to represent, the spiritual idea which it suggests.

2. ad, ‘in response to!

3. funera, the dead or the spirit of the dead. Funus is the
dead body in 1.17. 8 =
