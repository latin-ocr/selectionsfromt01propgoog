upon Propertius. Be that as it may, it is certain at
any rate that no intimacy can have existed between
the two poets. Tibullus also is never mentioned through-
out the poems. ’

MSS. and Editions cys Propertius.

The text of Propertius is notoriously in an unsatis-
factory condition: amongst the texts of the great Roman
poets there is none which presents difficulties so great.
The comparative value of the existing MSS. of Pro-
pertius, and their mutual relation to each other, have not
even yet been settled beyond dispute. Of these the first
to be mentioned is

N or Codex Neapolitanus. The superiority of this
famous MS. had been established by Lachmann ¹, and
accepted as an article of faith· by succeeding editors,
- including Professor A. Palmer, who published his admir-
able critical edition of the text in 18803 but it has
been called in question by L. Mueller, and more recently
by A. Baehrens, whose elaborate critical edition (1880)
is founded up'on a theory which assigns to this MS. only,
, a subordinate position in the constitution of the text.
In 1884, however, there appeared a French work on
Propertius by M. F rederic Plessis-a work which in
its grasp, lucidity, and critical acumen does honour to
French scholarship-which controverts the conclusions
of Baehrens, and, upon evidence which will probably
be accepted by future editors as conclusive, pronounces
the Neapolitanus to be beyond all question the oldest,
and incomparably the most authoritative, of tbe MSS.
of our poet. In this he agrees with Professor Palmer,

¹ Who, however, places it only aecond in importanoe, after
the Gronioganus.
