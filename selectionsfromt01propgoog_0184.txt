maadi. ‘It appears extremely probable that the ancients
gave the name smaragdus not merely to the precious gem which
vve call an emerald, but extended the term to fluor spur, green
vitrified lava (green Icelandic agate), green jasper, and green glass.
'lhere is a curious passage in Pliny, H. N. 37. 5, where he tells
us that Nero used to view the combats oi gladiators “in an

, emerald,” which is generally understood to mean a smooth polished

mirror made of some of the above substances; although, from the
peculiar phraseology employed, others maintain that the emperor
was nearsighted; and used a concave eyeglass formed out of the
gem. See Beckmann, History os Inventione, vol. 3. p. 176!
