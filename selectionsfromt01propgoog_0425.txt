Ἴ 358 NOTES.

11. curru avorum, A triumphal car placed in the uesti-
bulum, the open space in sront oi the door of a Roman mansion.
Statues were placed there, especially equestrian: but the grandest
thing of all was to have a triumphal chariat. InJuv.7.125-128
an Aemilius is mentioned who has both an equestrium statne and
a triumphalcar as well:

haim enim stat cumas aeneus, alti
Quadriruges in vestr'bula'u atque ipse feroci
Bellatore sedem.
Postgate describes cumas as a ‘typical' singular, and compares a.

4 4 Haec spolia, haec reges, haec mihi cumas erunt.

12. pignora, probably her children, children being constantly
spoken of as ‘pledges’ ol affection. But the word may include also
all the external marks ol her character and position.

13. trabum, ‘experienced‚' ‘found :’ this sense also ofhabeo seems
to be connected with that ol ‘ to use,' ‘ to deal with? Cp. 1. 1. 8.

Il habat be read, cornelia is emphatic

15. noctes refers to the physical darkness below, 'as we see by
the addition olpaludes and unda .· they may all be called manaurae
as belonging to the region of the condemned. ‘Nights of con-

of the condemned ' (Postgate).

tenta, like flumine languido, attributed to the Cocytus, Hor.
Od. a.14.17.

16. implicat, equivalent to the allzgat of Virg. Geo. 4. 480.

18. Pater is probably Plut0, so-called as supreme in the world
below. Postgate suggests it may mean Cornelia’s father, as women
were sometimes handed over to be tried by their family. But hic
corresponds to huc 1. 17: to read Mne, ‘in consequence ol my
innocence,' is unnecessary and lar-fetched.

Det . . . mollia tura, ‘May he judge me mercilully.' The ¹
phrase is used loosely: dare iura properly means to ‘lay down
laws,' ‘ prescrihe a constitution,‘ etc.

19. st aare Aeacus, somewhat contemptuously, ‘Some Aeacus
or other‚' Aeacus being a subordinate judge to Rhadamanthus. She
desires Pluto himself to take her case out of the courts, and deal
gently with her: if not, she is prepared to face Aeacus, and meet
her doom.

19, 20. posita urna . . . sortita pila. As Postgate points out,
the urn might be either (1) that from which the jury was drawu;
or (a) the voting um; or (3) the urn by which the order ol the
