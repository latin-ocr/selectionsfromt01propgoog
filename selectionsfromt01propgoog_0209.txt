10. He was said to live for twenty-five years, at the end oi which
period he was supposed to drown himself by leaping into the Nile,
Quos dignetur agros, aut quo se gurgite Nili
Mergat adoratus trepidis pastoribus Apis '

Stat. Sylv. 3. a. 115. He was then interred with great pomp, and
the priests wandered about ior some days, shrieking, beating their
breasts, and exhibiting every outward form of grief, until a new
Apis was found, when the discovery was celebrated by a joyful
festival, termed the Theophanis, or Manifestation of the god. This
lasted for five days. All the ceremonias, together with an account
of the nurture os the young Apis, are detailed by Aelian. See
P'richard's Egyptian Mythology‚ p. 5053 Jablouski, Pantheon
Aegypt. 4. a, etc

‘There were other sacred bulls besides Apis. Such was Mnevis,
worshipped at On or Heliopolis; Pacis, at Hermonthis; and one of -
vast sire, with his hair reversed, called Onuplris. See Prichurd, as
above.

‘We may conclude this notice by quoting the words of Pliny.
H. N. 8. 46 Bas in Aegypte etiam numinis viee celitur, Apim vacaret.

on to give an account oi his oracular powers, and of his having been
consulted by Germanicus Caesar! ¹

According to the view of Brugsch (Religion u. Mythologie der
alten Aegypter, 1884) and that of many recent Egyptologers, the
fundamental conception of the Egyptian religion was that there was
one universal divine essenee, which expanded itseli into various
distinct deities, such as Ra, Arnen, Ptole, Osiris ; while by a reverse
process, each oi these derived deities might also assume the form and
the attributes of the one supreme originating power. Thus Nun is
distinctively the primal water element, from which all things were
formed by the one soul oi the whole, which isat once identical with,
and yet distinct from it; and Ra is the principal title sor the Sun,
who is one main symbol of the divine permeating soree. Yet in
localities specially sacred to Amen, he may be invoked, not only
under his own name, but also as A men-Nun, oras Arnen-Ra. Ra
is especially the rising Sun‚ as Tum or Atura is the setting Snn: and
as the Sun sets and rises again, so Osiris is held to live again- aiter
