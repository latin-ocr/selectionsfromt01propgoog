evening walk, '

Fallacem circum vespertinumque pererro

Saepo forum, adsisto divinis ;
and there is a very interesting passage in Juvenal, Sat. 6. 542,
regarding foreign impostore, Jews, Armenians, Syrians, and Chal-
daeanS, who passed from house to house vending their prophecies.
It would appear from the'lines before us, that boys were *wont to sit
in the streets [or the purpose ol affording the passere by an oppor-
tunity ol trying the divination by sortes. These sortes were slips of

⁸ Ι parchment or pieces of'wood, upon which certain words or senten'ces

were inscribed. They were mixed together in a box or, urn, oue wasv
drawn or shaken out, at random, and a conclusion formed from the
expressions which it contained, as applied to the particular circum-
stances of the person who made the experiment ¹. The sortes of the
temple of Fortune at Praeneste were among the most celebrated in
Italy. Cicero has a dissertation upon the subject in general, and
upon these in particular in his treatise De Div. a. 41.

‘Some understand that the puer, 1. 11, was employed only to
draw out the lots, because Cicero says of those at Praeneste, Fortunae
· monitu, putri manu, mittentur atque ducentum but the words illa
sustulit seem to preclude that interpretation here. Again, a question
hasbeen raised with regard to the second clause, illi Rettulite
triviis omino certa paor, whether these words are merelya continua-
’ tion and explanation of those which precede, or whether they relate
to another species oi divination, and point out that, in addition to
drawing the sortes, Delia sent a boy to a place where three ways
met, in order that he might watch sor an omen and announce to her
what he had seen. This last interpretation seems'somewhat forced,
but has been adopted by Dissen. Finally, we may notice the in-
genious conjecture ol Muretus, which has been adopted by several
editors, who would substitute trinis for tn‘viis, making the pre·
diction depend upon the result obtained by drawing the lots three
times, three being a mystical number.’ ' y

¹ Tacitus, Germ. 10, gives an account of a species os divination,
practised among the Germans, resembling this.
