20. moeris extrema conditione. See note above on 1. 19. 2.
21. subducet, scarcely an appropriate word with flamma and
imber, as it properly implies a silent stealthy withdrawing. Possibly,
like Horace's edax, it may apply to the gradual corrosion and decay
of damp. But' in the passage of Pind. Pyth 2, which Propertius

seems to have imitated, the corresponding words xetne'ptot ὄμβρος ’

referto a sudden storm.
23. quaesitum again suggests the superbiam Quaesitum
meritis oi Hor, od, 3. 30. 15.
ab aevo, ‘at the hands of time* or ‘ in consequence of! Or
the ab might be instrumental, stronger than 'aevo alone. Pinder
translates ‘ shall tall away from time’ or ‘life’ ‘From time’ makes
’ no sense; and aevum does not signisy ‘life ' as distinguished from
‘death,' but only ‘a life-time'
With these last lines cp. Shelley, Adonais: ·
And lte is gatterea' to tlte kings os thought
Who waged contentiva with their time's decay,
And of tlte past are all that cannot pass away.

III. 3.

ONCE more Propertius returns to the theme that Apollo aud the
Muses have forbidden him to sing in heroic verse the glories oi
Roman history, and 'wamed him to confine himseli to elegiae verse.
So exactly Hor Od 4.15.1

Phoebus volentem praelia nze loqui

Victas ct urbes increpuit lyra,

Ne parva tyrrhenum per aequor
Vela darem.

So completely had the examples os Homer and Ennius placed Epic
poetry upon a level above all other, that those who laboured in any
other field felt that they could not make good their claim to be poets
at all without apology. But it is to be marked, that while there is a
truer note of manly modesty in Horace's estimate os his own powers
and his aims, so, in the very act os sels-depreciation, he has thrown
an undying historical halo round the very men and acts whose praises
he announces himself unwilling to sing. The hum oi the toilsome
bee oi Mount Matinus has sounded not less bravely, has ministered
to Fame no less potably, than the note oi the Dircaean swan,

The piece is in the form oia dream or allegory' m which Apollo
warns the poet away from severer studies, and Calliope promises him
inspiration in Elegiae poetry.
