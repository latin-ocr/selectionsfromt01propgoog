PROPERTIUS, 111.11.,a5-36. 309

31. maincia is read by N. and should probably be adopted.
‘The price asked of her abandoned husband,’ ‘the price he had to
pay? If comacli be read, it must bear the same meaning, as=
coniugis. The coniugium was not foul to her: the disgrace was not
in her making such a demand, but in his being ready to entertain
it. The idea is exactly the same as that of Florus 4. 11 Haec
mulier Egyptia ab ebrio imperatore pretium libidinum Romanum
imperium petiit. The genitive is a subjective genitive: ‘the price
to be paid by the husband' H. quotes Juv. 12. 62 tempora pros-
pera vectoris, ‘the weather of, i. e. enjoyed by, the passenger.'

It is worth noting that the Romans laid no blame on Caesar for
his notorious connection with Cleopatra, which nearly eost him his
lise and reputation in the Alexandrina war. This no doubt was
partly because he war Caesar; but mainly because he did not allow
her to be a disturbing element in his political career. What the
Augustan poets brand as unpardonable in Antony was that he
suffered himself to be estranged from Rome by Egyptian ties, and
attempted to bring the power os the East to bear upon Rome in war.

32. addictos. See above on l. a.

33. dolls aptissima uuus. The Romans, like most nations,
believed all foreigners to be more treacherous and untruthiul than
themselves. They regarded the Greeks as a nation oi liars and
flatterers: perfidia plusquam Punica was a proverb with them. The

Greeks shared their estimate‘ oi the Egyptians: Pinder quotes Aesch. ,

Fraa- 299
δεινοὶ πλέκειν τοι μηχανὰς Αἰγύπτιοι.
‘Perfide Albion ’ atiords another example: with us, again, it is a
matter oi faith that French, Germans, Italians, Americans-all
nations in short with whom we come in contact-are less honest and
veracious than ourselves.
34. totiens, referring to the various scenes oi violence and

· treachery that had been enacted on Egyptian territory—the murder

of Pompey, the famous siege oi Alexandria when Caesar was in
such eminent peril, and lasfly, the scandalous excesses oi Antony
and Cleopatra.

35. arena, the Egyptian shore on which Pompey was struck
down on landing by his old centurion Septimius, by order oi the
Egyptian king’s advisers, on the aoth Sept. 13. e. 48.

tres triumphos, ie. Pompey’s three great triumphs: (1) for·
his Numidian victorieS, Β. c. 81 ; (a) sorbis successes in Spain over
Sertorius, tac, 71: (3) ior his conquest oi Mithridates, Β. e. 61.
