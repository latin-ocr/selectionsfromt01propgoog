· taken at randum names commonly current, without investigating
very closely their origin or their relations to each other.

‘Amalthea is in Varro¹ the Sibylla Cumana, who, he says, by
others is called Herophile or Demophile. Again Herophile, in
Pausanias, is ὼε Sibylla Erythraea, buthe quotes certain verses,
said to be composed by herself, in which she declares that she was a
native os Marpessus², a city oi which, Pausanias adds, traces still
remained in his time upon Phrygiau Ida· A Marpessos, however, in
this situation is mentioned by no other ancient authority³‚ while
Stephanus Byzantinus ⁴, Suidas and others place a Mermessus on
this very spot. Hence Salmasius would change Μάρπησσος, in
Pausanias, into Μίρμησσος, and read Mermessiu in Tibullus, instead oi
Marpessin. But whetherwe adopt Marpesia orMernmsiu,itmustbe
taken as an epithet oi Herophile, and the punctuation ol Huschke,

Quidquid Amalthea, quidquid Mermessia dixit,

europem Phoebo grataque quod monuit,

by which Mermessia is made to indicates personage distinct from
Herophile, can scarcely be received. On the other hand, is we place
the comma-after Herophile, as in our text, the words Pinnio
grataque qued monuit stand isolated without any noun to which
gratu can be referred. Hence critics have supposed that Phoebo has
been substituted by some ignorant transcriber for the name oi a
Sibyl, and Vossius would substitute Demo, who, according to Hy·
perochus, was ὼε Cumana, while Lachmann. conjectures Phaeto

¹ Serv. Aen. 6. 72 says it is not clearly known which oi the
Sibyls composed the Roman eracles, yet it is certain that they were
brought to Tarquin by a woman named Amalthea.

‘¹ Salmasius, however, has avery happy conjecture, according to
which the Sibyl will declare that she herself was of Erythrae, and
