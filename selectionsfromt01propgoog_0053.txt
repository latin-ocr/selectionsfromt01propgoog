or labour on the early legends of Rome or Italy. The
question is no't without interest: for by relegating to the
poet’s earlier days all the poems in Book lV which
cannot be dated, it is possible to interpret literally the
words ol Propertius when he ‘says 2. 1. 4

Ingenium nobis ipsa puella facit,

‘my love herself is the maker of my Muse,’ and to
bestow on Cynthia the glory os having been the main,
if not the only, inspirer of his genius. Mr. Postgate
says, ‘Without the stimulus os his love, and without the
sympathy and encouragement of his beloved, his genius
might never have broken the crust of lethargy which
covered it . . . . With the extinction of his love decayed
his poetic activity. . ’. . “His Muse,” as Hertzberg sayS,
“ sank to silence with his love.”’ There is no doubt that
Cynthia's literary taste¹ did much to stimulate the pnet's
genius, and to throw his love lor her into the imperish- ι

Splendidaquc a docto fania refulget avo ;

he calls her docta, the characteristic epithet os poets in 1. 7. ιι,
13. 11 and in a moment ol anger declares, 2. 11. 5-6

Et tua transibit contemnens ossa viator,
Nec dicet, Cinis hic docta puella fuit,

as though her title to ‘learning ' would naturally be acknowledged
ffifflone' In 2. 1. 27-32 he declares the causes ol his love

Quum tibi praesertim Phoebus sua carmina derret,
Aoniamque libens Calliopea lyram ,-

Unica nec desit iucundis gratia verbis,
Omnia quaeque Venus quaeque· liiinerva probat.

His tu semper eris nostrae gratissima vitae,
Taedio dum miserae sint tibi luxuriae.

See too the passage, 2. 3. 9-22.
