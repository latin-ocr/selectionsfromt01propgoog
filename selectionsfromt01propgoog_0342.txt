proponeremus 3, 21-35. 275 ⁵

whilst in the next words Horace illustrates Pan Tegeaee by ranking

poets with Fauns and Satyrs:
ut malesanos

Adscn'psz't Liber Satyris Faunisque poetas.

31. mea turha, ‘ deor to me.' Doves were sacred to Venus;
and ιιι the grotto was a spring in which doves were dipping their red
beaks. The idea was probably a common one for representation on
wall or floor. In the museum of the Capitolt there rs a lovely piece
of mosaic representing this subject known by the name of‘ The
Doves os Pliny,' so called because Pliny thus describes a work of the
mosaic worker Sosus: auranitis ibi columba bibens et aquam uusbro
capitis infuscans. Apricautur aliae scabentes sese in canthari
labro.

32. Gorgoneo lacu Another far-setched allusion to Hippo·
crene.

putea, used here os the colour, as in Hor. Epod. 9. 27, for the
more common puniceus: Poenus, Poenicus, Punicus, puniceus are all
alike derivedfrom φοῖνιξ, the famous purple-dyc having been dis·
covered first by the Phoenicians.

33. Diversae has properly reference to motion turned apart'
as diuersi abeunt. Here it means ‘each ιιι her several place!
Diuersa, read by Ν., would have' the same meaning. Let the young
student beware oft translatipg diuersus by‘ divers)

rura. here' rs unmeaning, and it is obvious how the error arose.
In the line before, N. reads nostro for rostra: Hamb. apparently has
nostra in the margin. It would seem that the first letter of the
word, probably also that of rura just below it, had dropped out: the
r was then inserted by mistake before ura instead os, or as well as,
before ostra. Iura involves a very slight change and gives a good
sense. Each os the Muses had her own province.

34. dona, mthe sense os munera implymg then several fimo·
tions and capacities.

emanere, the strict meaning os which rs to ‘keep’ at work rs
here almost exactly our ‘exercise'

35. haaron. The' 1vy, as sacred to Bacchus, was the plant of
poetic inspiramen, and hence busts of poets were crowned with' 1vy:
Hor. Od. 1. ι. 29

Doctorum hederae praemia frontium.

Prop. specially connects the ivy with lighter themes: 4. 1. 61

Ennius hirsuto cingat sua dicta corona:
Mi folia ex hedera perurge, Bacche, tuo.
