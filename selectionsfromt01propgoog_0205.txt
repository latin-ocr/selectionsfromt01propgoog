mser, the Loire. It will be noted th'at Tibullus takes a wide
sweep through the names of Gaul, and by no means confines himself
to Aquitania. The epithet caerulo must either refer to the estuary of
the Loire, with its sea water, or else be an unmeaning general
epithet applicable to streams in generah for no epithet could be less
applicable to the Loire itseli As a mle, the Roman poets had a
true eye sor streams and rivers, and generally describe them by
characteristic terms. Their descriptione of mountain or forest
scenery, on the other hand, are iu the last degree conventional and
vague.

13. The poet now passes on to describe Messalla's exploits in
the East, and begins by addressing the Cydnus <the T ersoos), the
one famous river oi Cilicia, which rises in Mount Taurus and passes
by the walls of Tarsus, birth-place oi the apostle Paul.

14. This line is generally thought corrupt from the redundancy

· of placidus aquia. It is impossible, as some propose, to take these

words as datives for adaquas, ‘creepest on to the calm waters ol the
lake’ (Pind.), in allusion to the swamp called the ῥῆγμα, into which
Strabo says the Cydnus emptied itsels. The words per vada, how-
ever, do seem to refer to such shallows: if so, tacitis undis will
describe the general character of the river, placidis'aquis the broad
smooth suriace of the swamp or lake into which it passed.

15. quantu· et, ‘I will tell too how great?

16. urat, the MS. reading, is obviously corrupt, and all
editors now agree in substituting alat. ,This makes good sense;
for Strabo tells us that Mount Taurus was cultivated to the very
summit. The construction of the passage requires tlre subjunctive

’ mood, and even is it were not so, the idea that Taurus arat Cilices

can be equivalent to Cilices arant Taurum, gravely put forward by
Scaliger, is as absurd as to say that ‘the eat killed the mouse’ is
equivalent to ‘the mouse killed the cat.’ Scarcely less absurd is
H.'s interpretation ‘Mount Taurus cuts through or traverses the
land of the Cilicians.’ Mount Taurus does nothing of the kind, nor
can the Latin be made to say so,

18. ennom, not ‘hallowed by' (Pind.) as if Palaestino Syro were
an ablative, but ‘sacred to, holy in the eyes ol, the Syrian of Palestine.‘
