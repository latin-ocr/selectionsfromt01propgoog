bc noted that N. reads quae in l. a, where it is clearly ont of place:
hence probably the mistake.

5, 11. The whole passage down to 1. ryforms the protasis:
‘ 1r you care for the sights ol' travel, aud it is that taste which keeps
you away from your friends, know that in all things Italy surpasses
all other countries' Some have supposed srom the somewhat wild
concatenation of persons and places brought together in the follow-
ing lines, that Propertius reserred to statues or otherrepreseutations to
be seen at Cyzicus. But this idea spoils the sense. The mixture of
m ology and geography, without regard to the relative position
ol the places, is quite after the manner oi Propertius, and we need

Β not expect to find him mentiouing persons or places in gulde-book

order.

Bellen. Helle, the daughter oi Athamas, gave her name to
the Hellespont into which she fell.

6. movere. Moneo and commoveo are the special words used

Animo commoveor, etc, is a frequent phrase in Cicero.

7, 8. Ι. e. ‘whether you go to see Mount Atlas and the islands
called the Gorgades’ Pliny mentions these islands as five days' sail

western proinontory oi Africa. Here the Gorgons lived: Hanno,
adds Pliny, carried off two oi their hides (cutes) to Carthage.

Phorcidos, i. e. of Medusa, daughter of Phorcus.

9. muenia, genitive of Geryon or Geryoms, is probably the
true reading, preserved as Gier'om's in N.: the common reading,
Geryonae, would be the genitive oi Geryones, as Pelidae oi Pelides,
geometrae of geometres, etc.

alena are no doubt the signs of ὼε struggle supposed to be
preserved on the spot. Oi similar nature was the boot-print left by
the horses os the Dioscuri on the shores of Lake Regillus, and the
mark left by St. Peter's head in the wall of the Mamertina prison.
The palace ol Antaeus, the scene of his condiet with Hercules, and
the gardens of the Hesperides, were placed at Lixus, a colony planted
by Claudius in Tingitana or Tangiers, Plin. 5. 13 while the island of
Erytheia, on which Geryon led the cattle carried off by Hercules,
was identified with the island (now Isle de Leon), or islanda, on
which the Phoenicians placed their famous colony of Gades, re·
garded by Greeks and Romans alike as the westernmost limit of the
world. Hence lIor. od. a, 6. 1

Septimi Gades aditure mecum etc.
