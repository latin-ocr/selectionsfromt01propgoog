PROPERTJUS, IV. 3., 49-53. ΔΙ337 ,

only (Il. 21. 334) are Notus and Zephyrus conjoined. Thus these
four winda are not regarded as being at right angles to each other:
Boreas is nearer to Zephyrus, Notus is nearer to Eurus.

49. aperto ln samace, ‘in the case of an acknowledged
husband? For in, attached in this sense to a verb ol loving‚ cp.
Hor. Od. 1. 17. 19 laborantes in uno ,⁴ id. Epod. 11. 4 in pueris aut
in puellis urere ,· and Prop. 1. 14. 7

. Perditus in quadam tardis pallescere curis v

Incipis.

50. Pinder points out the alliteration ol this line. ν

51, tint cannot be right here : there is no point in ‘tlry purple'
if the line⁸ be punctuated naturally as in the text, and to read with
Pinder, Bae.. etc. nam milri que? tibi, etc. is harsh us well as point·
less. Palmes prefers ter, and suggests que . . . que as a possibility.

52. meas is clearly right. Bae. follows most MSS. in reading ’
tuas, which can only be interpreted ‘these hands which iri very truth are
thine‘-an intolerable ambiguity, aud not supported by such phrases
as Blanditias meas, ascula mea (‘kisses, etc, meant sor me'), quoted
from Tib. 1. 9. 77, etc Coaxings and kissings are transferable, hands
are not. .

aquom The Romans accounted for the coldness and clearness
of crystal by imagining that it contained water frozen into ice. Thus
Ι Claud. Epig. 11

Dum chrystalla puer contingere lubrica gaudet,
Et gelidum tenera pollice versat onus ,·

Vidit perspicue deprensas mamare lymphas,
Dura quibus solis parcere nevit hiems ‚¹

Et siccum relegens labris sitientibus arbem
Irrita quaesitis oscula figit aquis.

53. suda, transferred from the active meaning ‘ not hearing’
to the passive ‘not heard,’ noiseless. So caecus of a thing not
⁴s·een; asLuer. 1. 271 ol the winds, ·

Sunt igitur venti nimirum corpora caeca.
0111014- 5· 58
Istius tibi sit surda sine arte lyra.

raris Kalendis, i. e. ‘but seldom-on the first ol the month‚'
‘no ostener than once a mouth! Raris is a general epithet of
Kalendis, not a determining epithet. Cp. sunus extremum 1. 17. 2 3
and note. The Lnres were usually worshipped on the N ones and
Ides as well, Cato, R. R. 133.

meta: this -was the regular duty of the una puelle, the
single maid-servant to whom her establishment was reduced. Pros.
