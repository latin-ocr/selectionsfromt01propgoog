flare ponem. So Jacob, for the MS. reading stere polest, which
has neither sense nor grammar in its favour. There has been no
question of weeping or trouble, but only of life safe, in contrast to
life lost. From l. ²9 the poet has been harping on one theme, the
dangers of.the sea, the safety of the lund. T erra pamm 1. 31 ; suo

the same idea, and prepare us for ⁶ Poor, but on dry land, where no
storm can blow.’ Stridorem procellae, l. 47, catches up the same
theme. Postgate justly says that the rendering ‘where blowing has
no power’ is very harsh: 1 would add, quite unnatural. But when
he adds that ‘where nothing can blow’ is not true, he adopts a
standard of truth so strict that it would condemn one-half of the body

italicised contain more truth than the statement that land, as con-

‘Poor, I grant you: but where on earth is it possible to find no

of the expression, such a sentiment seems to me neither ancient in
