Nonam is the woodland, situated on a hill overlooking the Tiber,
on the slope of which-probably the Janiculum or the Vatican—
Tullus’ villa was built. The wooded hill is thus said ‘tostretch out
the planted trees on its top ι’ and 1. 6 makes it clear that Propertius
’ is dwelling on the size of the trees, not, as Burmann and others sup·
pose, on the extent 'os the wood. Nor can intendat mean ‘to
thicken‚’=arboribns denset, as Schultze supposes. The only other
possible interpretation is ‘how the wood stretches out, i. e. rents
high, the trees at their top' *or ‘with their top :’ but this is weak
and tautological.

The metaphors are strangely abrupt: ‘Then do the waters of
Pactolus pour under my roof, then do 1 gather gems under the Red
Sea.’ The Red Sea of the ancients was the whole Indian ocean, and
they hod a fancy that its bed was rich with gems. Thus of the penrl¹
