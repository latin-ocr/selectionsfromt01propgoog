222 NOTES.

point was that these heroes had each a friend who could worthily
sing their praiseS, but that he had not the power to celebrate the
glories of Augustus.

39. mosmos. The Phlegraei campi (τὰ φλεγραΐα πεδία)
was the name given to the volcanic region which extends along the
coast of Campania to the north of Naples (now called Solfatara), and
which was the supposed scene of the victory over the Titans and
their punishment by Zeus. Cp. 3. 9. 48.

40. 1nt0net, with potential foroe, implying not merely that
Callimachus did not sing the battles of Zeus, but that he felt himself
incompetent to do so. ,

augum pectore gives the 'reason for his incompetence. F.
has augusto, a not impossible reading: ‘with all that great heart of
his, he yet,’ 'eto

41. conveniunt, personally, by a rare use, insteadof the usual
impersonal convenit. Such phrases however as res convenit, even .
condiciones (perid convenerunt (Nepos), are found. Here the'sense
is ‘nor is my genius fitted’

duro . . ‚versun of epic hexameter verse, in distinction to the
soft and tender strains of elegiae poetry. Cp. the Epigram of
Domitius Marsus upon Tibullus:

Te queque Vergilio comitem nen aequa, Tibula,
Mm iuvenem campos arisit ad Elysios,
Ne soret, eut elegis molles qui fleret amores,
Aut caneret sorti regia bella pede.
Cp. too 2. 34. 44
Inque tuos ignes, dure poeta, veni,
where the contrast is between amatory poetry (ignes) and Lynceus’
efforts in tragedy (dure poeta).

Mollis is the regular word used by Propertius to describe his
own poetry; in 3. 3. 18 he speaks of his own mollia prata in con-
trast to heroic verse ; cp. l. 2 above.

42. condere is used in a somewhat grandiloquent sense for.
‘to compose,' with such words as carmen, poema, etc. 0vid, in a
passage similar to this, Trist. 2. 336, has

Divitis ingenii est immania Caesaris acea
Condere.
Here there seems to be an additional idea taken frorn other mean-
ings of conde, such as ‘to store up,’ ‘to lay by,' of treasure, etc, so as
to give a sense at once of value, of permanence‚ and of remoteness;

he is unfit to go back, as it were, to the remotest times, and assign
Caesar a lasting place among his Phrygian ancestors.
