¹ and Hileia were the two great masters of the Alexandrina
Elegiae School, a school whose characteristic feature was a mixture
of poetry with erudition. Philetas of Cos was the younger of the
two: he lived under the first Ptolemy, by whom he was appointed
to be tutor to his son Philadelphus, and died probably between 290
and ²70 nc. Callimachus a member of the noble family of the
Battiadae of Cyrene, was patronised by Philadelphus andwas chief
librarian of the famous Alexandrine library (of which the main part
was bumt during the blockade of Julius Caesar) from circ. 260 to
240 13. e. Besides being a poet, Callimachus was one of the most
famous grammarians and critics of the Alexandrine school, and his
poems were a marvel of laboured and affected learning. Fragments
of his hymns and epigrams remain; but he was especially deemed the
prinae of elegiae poetry, and in this branch the best idea of his tortuous
and erudite style is to be obtained from Catullus' adaptation of his
Coma Berenices Philetas was deemed second to Callimachus: less
oppressed with leaming‚ he had probably more genuine poetic
' feeling. His main works were elegias in praise of his mistress
Bittis or Battis. Propertius speaks of both with the utmost rever-
ence as his masters. Besides the passage before us, see 3. 9. 43
Inter Callimachi sat erit placuisse libellos,
Et cecinisse modis, Cae poeta, tuis

ln 2. 34. 31-2, whatever reading be adopted, the two poets seem
placed on a par; but in 3. 3. 51-2 he derives his inspiration from
Philetas alone,

Talia Calliope, lymphisque a fonte petitis
Ora Philetaea nostra rogavit aqua.

1. saera. Postgate is surely wrong here. Sacra no doubt is
used of any ‘sacred things ;' but the explanations ‘sacred reliques,’
and ‘the disembodied spirit,’ are neither consistent in themselves,
nor with the passage as awhole. The idea is the same which we

, have had above, 2. 10. 24Ι

Pauperibus saeris vilia tura damus,

where see note. The poeta are priests of the Muses; to be ad-
mitted to their holy grove, to take part in their holy rites, is to be
admitted a brother of the gnild. Callimachus and Philetas being
dead, Propertius addresses their Manes ; and using that ‘disjunctive-
uess’ of expression which has been illustrated on 2. 15. 37 (see
Postgate’s introduction), he speaks of the Manes of Callimachus and
the sacra of Philetas as ifhe meant two distinct things What he
means is simply ‘0 Shades of Callimachus and Philetas, admit me to
your holy grove, and let me too have a share in your holy sites?
