minus was worshipped by the proprietors on each side of the march·

ᾶοιοττιιι, i.e. standing by itself in a field, as opposed to in
mmihi· libratum. The verb liba (λάβω) properly means ‘to pour,
and is specially used of libations poured upon the ground or upon an
altar to a god. Hence it means generally ‘to offer in sacrifice,’ as
exta canum Ov. Fast. 1. 389, munera ib. 647, and figuratively,
prop· 4 6rip⁷argite rae lymphis, carmenque recentibus aris ·
Tibia Mygdoniis libet eburna cadis.

agriam . . . deo should be read. No special god is intended.
'l'hesingularis used collectively= ‘the gods of agriculture ι’ epa. 1.36

Many MSS. have deun. obviously because ante was supposed to be
the preposition. In Prop. 4. 2. 45 Vertumnus says
Nec flos nllus hiat pratis, quin ille decenter
Inpositus fronti langrnat anie meae.

oi Jupiter's image on feast days with vermilion, and that the censors
let out the job on contract. He adds that the bodies of triumphing
generals, of whom he cites Camillus, were similarly treated. Similarly
Pan is represented in Virgil E. 10. 27 as
Sanguineis ebuli baccis minioque rubentem,
and in Tib. 2. 1. 55 the countryman in worshippirig Bacchus paints
himself with the same substance,
Agricola et minio suffusus, Bacche, rubenti.

See Plut. Qu. Rom. 98.
