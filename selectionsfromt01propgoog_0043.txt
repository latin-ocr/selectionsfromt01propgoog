set on the top of a hill, doubtless the same ¹town as that
described in l. 65 in almost identical words:

Scandentes si quis cernet de vallibus arces,·

and arces, not Asis, is the true reading. The town indi·
cated is one of the towns in the valley of the Clitumnus,
but it was not Asisium.

But even if Asz'st'were the true reading, the words of
Propertius do not indicate more than that he was born in
the neighbourhood of that town. lt is clear that the poet
here specifies a district, not a town. He again gives Um-
bria as his birthplace 3 patn'ae orabas reference to what
follows, and specifies the particular partos the province
with which he was connected. This is then described as
the part where the dank Mevania drips with moisture on
a plain, where waters steam from the Umbrian lake in
summer, and where the walls of a city rise up on a height.
No known lake would satisfy the conditions of the lacus
Umber: so the phrase is generally supposed to refer to a
part of the river Clitumnus, which, according to the
younger Pliny, 8. 8. 1-3, spreads out into a broad glassy
pool not far below its source. The fact then that Propertius
describes his Penates as being in a partos Umbria lying
close under Perusia, where lay Mevania and the Umbrian
lake, and the town set on a hill, is proor' that he means to
speciiy no particular town, but only to indicate a spot in
the Clitumnus valley withi'n reach of all the places he has
named. The phrase noti Penates no doubt refers to the
farm of which Propertius' father was deprived in the con·
fiscations of Β. c. 42, ancl implies that it was a property os
some importance. lt was in all probability situated
nearer to Arabium than to the other towns named above,
for the names Propertius and Propertio occur on several
inscriptions sound in or near that city. There is also evi·
dence to show that he was claimed as a municeps of that
town in the century after his death. For there exists at
. Assisi a stone with the following inscription:
