nova, because she had hitherto (l. 53) intermitted many of her
religious duties.

63. mnu. The apodosis is lest to be understood. ⁴ Let not
the glory of capturing Bactrabe of so great valae in your eyes as th'at
for sake of that you should prolong your absence’ The full con-
struction of tanti in such passages is seen in Juv. 3. 54 quoted

64. morato ᾱιιο1. ‘Some perfumed chief.’

carbasa lina, as Palmer observes, is not more forcible than
‘liaxen linen'wonld be. Lina seems a gloss: he suggests picta.

The construction is somewhat sostened by votiva.

Hertz. is probably correct in supposing that, together with* the first,
second, ninth, and tenth ‘of this book, it was intended to form part
of a poetico-antiquarian book of ‘Origines’ after the model of the
Αἵτια of Callimachus 3 and that, in all probability, these poems gave
