PROPERTIUS, ΙΙΙ. 7., 29-43. . 297

slender authority, a reading weaker in itself. F or the idea of sub·
stravit cp. Shelley: ¹
I see tlte dcep’s untrampledstoor.
38. suadem, impersonally: ‘that it go well with thee!
cophinus or caphereus, the S. E. promontory of Euboea.

· on which the Greek fleet was wrecked coming home from Troy,

allured by false beacons.

39. triumphales, in the very moment of their triumph. ,

40. tracta, another instance (like teneat, acta, etc, above) of
a vagae incomplete idea being used in place of a definite one. The
verb traho suggests ruin and disaster; it is used of the shipwreck
without any special reference to curreuts or other possible causes
for the mishap.

41. Paullatim, well explained by Postgate of the ‘gradual
piccemeal loss' of his companions by Ulysses. But the word goes
rather with the whole sense of the line than with iactreram specially.
Translate, ‘one by one)

42. N. has soli: soliti is due to Lipsius, and should be read.

43. Quod sl verteret can only mean ‘Were he now turning ;'
the imperfect is used rhetorically instead of the pluperfect, for the
sake of vividness. Propertius throws himself back to the time of the
shipwreck, when the action of verteret and viveret might actually
have been going on. Duxe'sset is necessarily the pluperfect, as it
refers to the choice made when Paetus determined on the voyage. ,
The peculiarity is that the tense of verteret is determined by veheret
. instead of by duxz'sset. Had verteret been actually (as it is virtually)
in the apodosis, there would have been no difficulty. ‘If Ulysses
had pald attention to my words, he would now be ploughing his
father’s lands and be living in presence of his own Penates! Iu 1.
17. 19-24 Propertius distinguishes accurately between the imperfect

¹ and the pluperfect:

Illic si qua meum sepelissent fata delorem,
Ultimus et postte staret ansere lapis,

Illa meo caros donasset funere crines,
Molliter et tenera pomret ossa rosa:

Illa mcum extreme clamasset pulvere nomen,
Ut milri rnen ullo pondere terra fieret.

Here sepelissent, donasset, clamasset refer to acts done once for
all, and past irrevocably; staret and poneret to continuing states or
acts, which might have been going on at the moment when the
words were spoken. See note on the passage.

contentus is to be taken with verteret, aud to some extent
