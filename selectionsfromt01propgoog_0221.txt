32. Cp. Or. Her. 1. 3¹
Atque aliquis posita mamtrat fera praelia incuso,
Pingit et exiguo Pergama tota mero .·
Hac ibat Simois, bic est Sigeia tellus,
Hic steterat Priami regia celsa seuis;
’ Illic Aeacides, illic tendebat Ulixes,
Hie lacer admissos terruit Hector equos.
So also Volture,
Et le oieux nouvelliste, une caune d la atain,
Trace au Palais Rayal Ypre, Farue et Denaiu,
where the tracing is done with a stick on the gravel.
’ 33. quia tutor . . ,l A common formula = ‘what madness
to.. ‚i’

34. tacito oum. Each word adds to the strength of the
other.

35-38. ‘This picture corresponds closely with the account of
the Infernal Reginus, to be found in Homer, who represents the
reulms os Hades as a gloomy and desolate region, where the spirits
oi the departed, although not suffering actual pain, are strangers to
enjoyment. See Tib. 1. 3. 56:

36. uterina navita turpia unae. Turpis here means ‘ngly,’
‘rough and uukempt.' So Virg. uses the word of a horse's head,
‘ngly,’ ‘clumsy,' Geo. 3. 523 of the scab, ib. 44¹3 of the loss of
looks in oid age, ib. 96; oi limbs fouled with mud, Aen. 5. 358.
The best MSS. read puppis: but the words would be readily inter-
changed, and puppis was evidently introduced to suit nauita by a
scribe who could not understand turpis. Charon is described by
virgil as horribili squalore Aen. 6. ²993 by Propertius as a torvus
senex 3. 18. o4; by Juvenal as a porthmos teter 3. 265.

37. The reading of A. is percussisque, which makes no good
sense. The words usto capillo show that some word is needed de-
scribing the condition of the cheeks after death, whilst still visible
on the flaming pyre. Strangely enough, the popular ancient belief
was that the shades bore in the infernal regions the sume appearance
as at the moment oi death, or even when half consumed by the
flames. In Virg. Aen. 495 Deiphobus appears with his body all
mangled: and Prop. 4. 7. 7-10 draws his vision of the deceased
Cynthia thus,

Eosdem babuit secum, quibus est elata, capillos,
Eosdem oeulos: lateri vestis adeosta suit ;

Et solitum digito beryllon adederat spuis,
Summaque Lethaeus trivero tora liquor.
