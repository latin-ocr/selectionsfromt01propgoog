WEARY of war and danger, the poet declares he has no care for
,wealth1 he will give up a soldier's life with all its hopes and
honours, and retiring to his humble country estate, will, live a life of
peace and simple ease, cultivating his fields and tending his flocks,
and happy till death with the love of Delia.

The introduction of Messalla's name, l. 53, implies that Tibullus
had reoeived an invitation from his ,patron to accompany him on
some military expedition, from joining in which, as part of the great
man's suite, substantia] profit might be looked for. There was no
surer way for a young man to push his fortunes, and to lay the
foundation ofa good balance at his banker’s, than to attach himself
to the cohors or suite of a provincial governor: and we know with
what furious invective Catullus assails the provincial governor whose
meanness (or sense os justice l) permitted his suite to return horne
empty—handed (Cat. 28). What then is the occasion to which the
invitation of Messalla refers? It could not have been Messalla's
command in Aquitania, nor his subsequent mission to the East, for
Tibullus accompanied him on both occasions (see Tib. 1. 3 and 7),
and we know of no foreign service of Messalla's after the latter
event. We must look therefore to some earlier employment; and
aswe know that Messalla took an important partin theActian cam-
paign, and commanded a division of the fleet in the battle itself‚ we
may with all probability infer that this poem w‘as composed in the
spring of rae. 31, ou the occasion of the poet's being invited to take
a part in that memorable campaign. It will be noted that the allu-
sions in the piece itself are more applicable to a campaign in which
active fighting was expected, than to an ordinary provincial corn·
mand. Assumiug this view to be correct, it is interesting to
compare this poem with the 1st Epode of Horace, composed under
precisely similar circumstances, and on the same occasion. Like
Tibullus, Horace disclaims all desire to make money out of his
