shore, ora rocky bottom; the attaching cable had chased (detrito)
and parted (cadum). Nocturnis procellas gives the general condition
of affairs: it niay have been the reason for their mooring, as wellas
the cause of the disaster. Unable to beat out against the wind,
they would moor off a lec-shore, as their only chance3 but the wind
and sea were too much for the ship, her moorings parted or dragged,
and she was lost. The vinculo andfuna, after the manner of Proper-
tius, refer to the same thing.

19. adnexa may go either with ligata vincula, ‘the cablesecured
to rocks,' or with detrito, iu which case ligata will agree with saxa,
the rocks being said tobebound instead of the ship,‘ the moored roclrs,'
standing for ‘the rocks to which she was moored.’ The latter in-
terpretation involves a confusion. not unnatural‚ between the saxa to
which the ship was mooted aud those against which she was dashed:
- both formed part of the same rocky shore. Or again, translating
ligata in the same sense, we may taire ad saxa with cadunt and the
general sense of ‘striking’ involved iu l. ao: ‘'The cable chased, her
moorings parted, and she was dashed against the rocks!

21-24. This passage is notable for Mr. R. Ellis' striking emen-
dation of Mimantis for minantis in l. aa, and for the original inter·
pretation which he has founded on it, and developed in his Prof.
Dissert, Univ. Coll.‚ London, 1872, now unfortunately out of print.
Mr. Postgate has adopted his reading and interpretation.

Here it is probably ‘the beloved object.’ as Ov. Am. 3. 9. 32
Altera cura recem, altera primus amor.
For the plural in this sense cp. the use of deliciae, amores, agius, to
denote a single person, asin Cic. Phil. 6. 5 sed redeo ad amores de-

22. Whatever the true reading of this difficult line may be,
there can be no doubt as to the general meaning of the couplet. ‘An-
other shore besides this one testiqes to the loss of a dearly-beloved
youth’ Ihave ventured uponareadingwhich is very slightly removed
from that of the Mss, and which appears to me to fit iu better with
the general tone of the passage than any which has been proposed.
The passage is one of intense feeling. lt rises in an ascending climax
of grief aud piteousness frum l. 5, where Paetus’ fate is first stated,
down to l. 28 ι in a tone of agony the poet fills in every circumstance
that can add to the feeling of horror and desolation at such a death.
lu the midst of this pathetic description come ll. 21, aa, in which
Propertius compares 'the fate of Paetus to that of Argynnus, a youth
