59, 60. The Romans were great as engineers; and none ot
their engineering works are more impressive or durable than their -
great military roads. So solidly were they built that the phrase
used for making a road is munire viam: and the architect Vitr‘u-
vius, who lived under Caesar and Augustus, has lest an exact
account of the mode of their construction. First the earth was
levelled and rammed down till it was solid; then came a layer of
rough stones for a foundation, with or without cement3 above this a
second layer of rubble, mixed with lime, and rammed down toa
thickness ofnine inches. On the top of all was a layer of hard pave-
ment stones, generally irregular in shape, laid carefully in a bed of
eement. These giant roads extended up to the extreme limits os
the empire; many portions of them exist still-notably of the Via
Appia—almost as firm as when they were first laid down. The
superintendenoe and repairs of the roads were offices of high dis·
tinction; Augustus himself had chargeof a district. The glarea os
1. 59 refers to the layers of rubble; the silex of l. 60 to the flat
stones, usually of basaltic lava, or other hard rock, which formed the
surface. The words apta iungitur am show how nioely the stones
were fitted.

they are the natural words to use of the bright sunlight, of the
brightness of joy and happiness, of the shining radianoe of a god, of
the bright beauty oi a young face, or the unclouded transparent
openness os a clear soul. ·

ans piece is probably the earliest of Tibullus' poems, and re·
sembles much the first of the first book in tone and subject. Our
poet was a lover of peace; and this poem was apparently written
on the occasion os his being called out as ayoungster to serve his
timeas an eques in the cavalry. He is to be torn, against his will,
from the peaceful pursuits and secure joy of his ancestral acres ; but
in what cause, or in what quartu, he was to serve, we haye no hint
to tell. If he were born, as supposed, in the year B. c. 59, his
obligation to military service would naturally have commenced in
Β. c. 42, when he was seventeen years of age; if so, he may have
been called upon to form part of the forces that were being raised in
that year in preparation for the campaign of Philippi. It is interesting
to think that Tibullus may have formed part of the pursuing host
