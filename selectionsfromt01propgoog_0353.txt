286 , NOTES.

25. For the whole os the following passage cp. Virg. Geo. 2.

, 475 ἐξ huno mundi domum, ‘this fabric ol the world.’ Domus

means essentially a building, or structure of some kind. As pointed
out above on p. 210, students are constantly led astray in translating
domus by the analogy of our ‘home' Cp. Virg. Aen. 10. r domus
Olympi, Geo. 1. 371 Α

Eurique Zephyrique domus,
and Prop. a. 16. 50

Fulminaque aetheria desiluisse domo.
So Shelley's blue dome of air.

27. denote, as the contrast with exoriens seems to show, of
the setting sun, not ol an eclipse. Gellius however has deficiente
luna of the waning moon, as opposed to crescente ; and that may
well be the meaning here. Lucan has romu coacto of the full moon,
when the filling in oi the orb makes the extremities ol the crescent
appear to meet, Phars. 1. 5 32.

Observe the indifference with which Propertius uses the indica·
tive and subjunctive mood throughout this passage.

29. superant, in its literal meaning, ⁴ get up upon the sea,'
‘rise’ So exactly Virg. Aen. 11. 514

, iugo superans aeduentat ad urbem,
‘ mounting by the ridge thus reaches the city?
31. ‘Whether a day is coming which,' etc. Lucretius affirms of
the universe that
Una dies debit exitio, multosque per annos
Sustentata ruet moles et machina muudi.
Several editors read si forsit.

32. Pinder points out that the ancients believed that the rain·
bow sucked up water from the earth and gave it back in rein.

33, The Perrhaebi occupied the northern part of Tbessaly.

34 ‘And the sun’s orb mourned with his horses draped in
black‚' a grandiloquent phrase for an eclipse.

35. serus versare, ‘slow in turning!

Bootes, ‘the Ploughman,' called also Arcturus or Arctophyldx,
‘the Beer-ward) The former name was applied to it because it
seems to represent the Ploughman or Waggoner who drives the whole
team round, Hence serus versare.

36. An admirable description of the Pleiades. The stam· which
form the group (rhomes) are so thickly set (spisso) that they appear
to run together (coit).

37. Cp. Job 38.11He'tlterto skalt thou corne, but uo further,
