so many islands. Ancient writers, indeed, are wont to compare it to
the Aegean sea, where the Cyclades and Sporades oller a similar
appearance, on a larger scale.'-Again, the same writer-⁸ Although
Lower Egypt is not altogether without rain, yet this so rarely falls,
as we retire srom the sea, that, under the constantly serene 'sky of
Thebes, the whole period oi man’s life may pass away without
the earth being refreshed from above with more than a moist dew.
The irrigation and fertility of the soil, therefore, entirely depend
upon the river, without which Egypt would have shared the fate

were to be found on the banks ot the Nile. Herodotus seems to
have entertained no doubts of the general truth os this assertion,
supported as it was by a mass of bold aud ingenious fabricatione.
But, as an acquaintance with the subject became more accurate and
extensive, subsequent writers found that many of the powers and
attributes os the Egyptian gods would, by no means, apply to the
members of the Grecian Pantheon, with whom they had been
identified by the father oi history3 aud although they seem never
