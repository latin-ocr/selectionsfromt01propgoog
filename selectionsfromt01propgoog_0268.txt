PROPERTIUSsI. 14, 20-23—17.‚ 1—11. 201

1. There is nothing to show whether the voyage oi this piece
was real or imaginary. In 1. 15 the poet speaks as ii he were about
to undertake a voyage in consequence of the treatment he had received
from Cynthia.

nt marks an abmpt beginning. The poet plunges in medias “
res: he starts in the middle of a gust of feeling, leaving what has
preceded to bennderstood. Cp. Ov. Am. 3. 12. 9

Et merito, quid enim forme praecaria feci ?

poeuis could bring myself to,’ ‘had the-beart to,' like the Greek
ἔτλην. ·

2. novenae. Alcyone, daughter of Aeolus, and her husband
Ceyx were for their presumption changed iuto sea-birds. The ancient
table was that the halcyon made xher nest upon the waters‚ and that
during that time calm prevailed Hence our ‘halcyon days ς’ here

Propertius calls on the halcyons in hopes that they will allay the
sturm. See Ov. Met. 11. 742—749‚ and Servius ou Virg. Geo. 1. 399.
So Theocr. 7. 57 ‚

Αλκυόνες στορεσεῦντι τὰ κύματα.

3. censionem, wife of Cepheus and mother of Andromeda,
was changed into a constellation, whose appearance through the
storm would be a sign oi brightening weather. Some suppose the
allusion to beto the town Cassiope or Cassope on the shores of Epirus,
mentioned by Strabo 7. 7 as a point made ior in the voyage to
Greece. The remains oi the town between Nicopolis and Pandosia
are at some distance from the sea, in the hilis: it was thus rather a
point to be sighted than a harbour to be made for. This would give
a much better meaning both to vaura aud to solito.

nolito is peculiar: it must be used adverbially‚=ex solitoj per-
haps such forms as gratuito, incerto, etc. may be regarded as analo·
gies. Hertzberg makes the prosy conjecture solidam, understandiug
Cassiope os the town. Paley makes the conjecture omine et lor
omnia l. 4; but we* are not aware of any omen specially connected
with the constellation, and omnia seems needed for emphasis.

6. increpat. The indicative gives greater emphasis, the indirect
question being ignored. See note ou 1. 8. 24.

8. tunae, as elsewhere in Propertius, is used for ‘a dead body'
So Virg. Aen. 9. 489 and 6. 510

Omnia Deriohobo solvisti et funeris umbris.

11. reponere is the reading of N.‚ and, if correct, must mean
‘to represent,' ‘to portray iu imagination,’ or, as Lemaire puts it,
‘remettre sous les yeux.' Ponere is used of any portrayal or descrip-
tion of a thing, whether in words, painting‚ or otherwise: and the rc
