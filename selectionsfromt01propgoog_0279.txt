212 NOTES.

as if created byour own minds, affeets them with double force. How
different from the gush of much modern sooalled poetry or oratory,
where words of passionate feeling are thrown away before an
attempt hasbeen made to depict the things, to summon up the
ideas, which would justify them l The lines before us form a oom-
position of the deepest tragedy: ‘Perusia-our country’s grave-
the hard death-time¹ of Italy? Every touch is instinct with feeling,
yet not one word expresses it. It is hard to refrain from translating
dura by ‘sadz’ yet that would be perhaps to modernise the pas·
suge. -

5. discordia, personified. ‘The demon of oivic strife?

egre Postgate translates ‘hounded on,’ quoting Ov. Met ¹4 750

quam iam deur ultor agebat,

and Hor. Epod. 7. 17.

But surely this idea is quite foreign to the word. ‘To hound on’
is to set dogs on to attack some one. There is no one here to be
attached. The notion of ogere is simply ‘to drive,’ best illustrated
by the common phrase for plundering, ‘agere et ferre,' ogere referring
to cattle, ferre (or rapere) to portable property. The picture is that
of a Fury or other evil power driving on remorselessly jaded and
wom-out herds, and allowing them no rest. We say ‘to drive dis·
tracted' in much the same sense. Cp. the fate of lo, οἱστροπλήξ.
Postgate also quotes Luc. 6. 777

Effera Romanos agitat Discordia Manes;

bnt the sense of ‘hounding on’ would require some object of abach or
purpose to be named, as in the fine but quite different passage, Virg.
Aen. 8. 678, where Augustus before Actium is gothering all Italy to

war. Hinc Augustus agens Italos in praeliis Caesar

Cum patribus populoque, Penatibus et mugnis Dis.
Here the meaning is not ‘hounding on,’ but ‘guthering in.'

6. Sed. So Palmer, I have no doubt correctly. There is an ana·
coluthon here. Tibi, l. 3, refers to Tullus, and the whole passage a-ro
amounts to this: ‘lf thou knowest Perusia, then lmow that I was born
just outside her walls’ But the mention of Perusia tums the poet into
a digression in which he apostrophises the soil of the Perusian plain.
on which his relative was east out unbnried: ‘Yet mine chief should

be the grief? The reading sit arose from the connection not being
undeirsdliidd, feminine, as in Ennius and several times in Propertius,
· who however has it masculine also.

7. perpessus as, ‘couldst endure to see? Or rather perhaps,
