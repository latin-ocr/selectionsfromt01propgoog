PROPERTJUS, lv. 11„ 67-85. 367

nbi, referring to Haec l. 71. The more usual construction
would be ut with the subjunctive=‘namely that! Haec . . . ubis
‘In these cases, namely where?

74. Hertz. well compares Cic. Verr. a. 1.44 Curlrune dolorem ei-
neri eius atque ossibus intonasti ? The confusion of metaphor is natural,
hut glaring; inusta must refer to branding, as adusto in 3. 11. 40

, Una Philippeo sanguine adusta nota,
the idea being suggested by cineri. ‘To brand upon ashes' would ,
be absurd: but the absurdity is relieved hythe ancient idea that the
ashes of the dead still live and feel, as in a. 13. 4²

Non nihil ad verrem conscia terro sapit.
¹ To suppose that spirat refers to the quivering flame (⁴ = ζῇ,’ Postgate)
seems farfetched, and introduces the new incongruity of the fleme
being itself branded or bumt in.

72-102. An exquisite passage; full of simple feeling, true to
human nature, and breatbing a tendemess and delicaey worthy of
the noblest type of womanhood

75. maternis vicibus, ‘the part of a mother? the plural, as
in Quint. Inst. proem. 4quendo divesne professionum vices essent

80. oscula falle. Fallere aliquid, as we have seen above
4. 4. ao, means ‘to exhibit deceit or treachery about something;’
so here, ‘give a feigned character to thy kisses,’ sicces genis, ‘hy
(presenting) dry cheeks :' ‘let thy dry cheak disguise the character of
thy kisses' ie. he was not to show, by the passionate nature of his
kiss, that there was more init than a mere father's affection for his
children. A touch absolutely' true to nature. Who has not seen, in
a similar case, the tears for a lost love pouring themselves out upon
the children? The words doubtless might mean ‘Be false to, or
cheat, their kisses by dry eyes (or cheeks)‚’ i.e. do not let thern see
that you have been weeping, but meet their caresses by a show of
indifference: but few will hesitate to prefer the first interpretation.

81. The nights, as though they were persons, are worn out by
Paullus' lamentations: cp. Virg. Aen. 8. 94 and Val. Flac. Aug. 5.
602 Mane diem noctemque fate'get Still more strongly Sil. Ital. 12.
496 mrasfategat.

82. in factam orafflta, ‘which you deem to assume my form,’
‘wronght by your fancy into my form!

84. He is not to speak on continuously‚ but to walt after
each verbum for an answer.

85. sen corresponds to seu 1. 91. She now turns to her chil-
dren, and prepares them for a double alternative: their father

marrying again, or remaining as he is.
