268 NOTES.

Phaeacian.‘ used as a synonym for ‘fat and comfortable,’ Hor. Ep.
1. 13. 24, and as an adjective by Juv. 15. ²3 Phaeaxpapulus.

mes, emphatic.

manant, here intransitive, ‘rises to the level os,’ ‘is equal
to.’ The proper meaning is transitive, ‘ to make equal,' i. e. ‘to make
one thing eqnal to another? In Virg. Geo. 1. 113

Cum primum uelem aequant saia,
the meaning is ambiguous: the word may either mean ‘make the
furrows equal,’ i. e. to each other, by obliterating all signs of the ridges;
or else ‘rise to the level of, become equal to, the furrows?

12. For operosa antra see 3. 1. 5 and note. The water ior the
grotto was to come from the famous Aqua Marcia, the first df the
great Roman aqueducts which was conducted for a considerable
distance on arches. It was built by Q. Marcius Rex, Β. c. 145, bring-
ing its water from Sublaqueum (the modern Subiere), a distance of
over sixty Roman miles. Of this distance more than seven miles was
above ground: and the remains of these arches, together with those
oi the more magnificent Aqua Claudia (built by the emperor
Claudius), form to this day one os the most impressive features oi the
Roman Campagna. In an arehway in the ancient walls, close to the
modern Porta S. Lorenzo, are still to be seen high in air the specus
or channels by which three of the principal sources of water-supply

reached the city. the Mareia, the Tepula, and the Julia. The lowest . l

of the three is the Marcia: and it bears the following inscription,
recording its restoration by Vespasian: Imp. Titus Caesar Divi F.
Vespasianus Aug. Paret. Max. tribuniciae potest. IX Imp. X V Ceus.
Cos. VII Draga, VIII riuum aquae Marciae uetustate dilapsum
reficit et aquam quaein usu esse desurat reduxit. Propertius again
speaks oi this aqueduct 3. aa. 24
Aeternum Marcius huntur apres.

The distribution of the water through the city was effected by leadeu
pipes (see Hor. Ep. 1. 10, 20): and Propertius in the present passage
refers to the possibility of ‘laying on’ the Marcian water by such a
pipe to an artificia] Muses' grotto. But though the Romans used
pipes to distribute water downwards from the higher points os the
aqueducts, it is clear that they did not know that water would rise to
its own level if eonfined: otherwise they would not have built miles
upon miles oi archways to bring their water across the low ground oi
the Campagna. The Auia Novus travelled over iourteen miles of
arches, some oi them 109 ieet in height!

13. cara. Lachmann quite unnecessarily adopts the variant
grata.
