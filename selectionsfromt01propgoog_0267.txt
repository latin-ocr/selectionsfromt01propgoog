Ι. 17.

This poem, together with the one which follows it, is among the
. most charmiug and touching of all the love-poems os Propertius.
They are poems which none other of the amatory poets of Rome
could have written, and which alone would be enough to give a dis·
tinguishing mark to his genius. They are essentially modern in their
character. There is no tinge of coarseness or artificiality, no trace
os the laboured aud pedautic couceits oi the Alexandriae school in
the love which they breathe. The puin and the love which the poet—
pours forth are esseutially romantio rather than classical in their
character; and as pure aud true to nature as the winds, the waves,
and the rocks which he addresses. The cast of the pieces is eu-
tirely modern: it may be doubted whether there are any poems iu
antiquity which come so near to the¹ spirit of the Nature school of
English poetry. Driven to despair by Cynthia's hardness‚ he embarks
upon a voyage, he buries himself in some lonely spot in the hope of
driving her image from his mind; but the first breath of a storm, the
soughing of the trees, and the sougs oi birds, only add luel to his
passion: he curses the folly which has induced him to tear himself
away from her, and every sight and sound only makes him feel the
more thatin leaving her he has lest the whole world behind him.
He speaks to the wiuds with the passion oi a Lear, to the trees and
the birds and the streams with the tendemess of a Rosalind; he
calls on the beeches and the pines to bear witness to his love ; be
carvcs Cynthia’s name upon their trunks, he shouts it aloud to the
rocks; he colours all nature with the intensity of his own feelings,
and looks ior her help aud sympathy in every phase oi his passion.
There is throughout that refined appreciation of the beauties ol naiure,
and that sense of their mysterious correspondence with the various
moods of man’s mind, which we are accustomed to regard as charac-
teristic of our own modern poets.
