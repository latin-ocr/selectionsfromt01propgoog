7. ²⁵bh. It is an over-refinement to say that Roma and seros nepotes
are identical. Rome is the abidlng personality of the city which-lives
through all generations of her sons; she may perfectly well therefore
be said ‘to praise Propertius amongst her distant grandchildreu!

will grow to its full height.
37, 38. His true fame will only be recognised inter seror

nepotes: buthe has secured at least that there shall be no dishonour “
· done to his remains upon his death. The allusion may be either to

the directions he has given to Cynthia, above, 1. 19 and 213. 41, 4a;
or, as some hold Lyce'o deo to indicate, to the admission of his works
into the ¹Palatine Library, founded by Augustus, B. c. 28. See a. 31
and introduction.

39, 40. Most of the MSS. commence a new Elegy with this
couplet: Hertz. and other editors place it at the end of El. 1. The
two poems seem in any case to be connected together. In the first,
Propertius asserts his position as a poet in somewhat high-flown lan·
guage, and compares himself to Homer. In ὼε second, he descende

beginning of the Second. If we so place them, they serve to soften
down the high pietensions just made, as though the poet felt he had
pitched them in too high a key, and to give a natural unpretending
close to the poem. Exactly similar is the light playful ending with
which Horace loves to close his more high-strung Odes.

Paley. But I now feel sure that N .’s reading detinuisse is right
The correspondence between detinuisse and neste'nue'sse seems
intentional. Detinuisse is applied to the animals‚ who were chained
to the spot, and kept from going on their ways; nestinuisse
implies effort and resistanoe, of the rivers whose onward course was
