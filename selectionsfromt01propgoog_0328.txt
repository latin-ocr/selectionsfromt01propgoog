PROPERTJUS, ιιι. 1.,7-16. 261

ries him aloit; in 10 the car becomes a triumphal chariot, in which

his muse, i. e. himself, is borne away, his Loves, like children, by his

side (11),anda crowd of poets following at thewheels (12). In13

heis in a chariot-race, on a course too narrow (14) for his rivals to
, have any hope of passing him.

9. a me late, ‘sprung from myself,’ ‘child of my brain’
(Postgate), like the carmina mn psius audita os Hor. od. 3. 1. a.

loconessam horses of a triumphing general were
wreathedwith garlands; and

11. his young sons rode with him ιιι the car. those who had
attained to manhood rode on horsebaek. Tacitus tells us that when
Germanicus triumphed he had five children' ιιι the car along with him.

12. The crowd of imitator poets follow after the car, as soldiers
after their general. secuta cannot exactly go with vectantur, as
they were ou foot. Either the general sense os ‘marching‚' ‘ad-
vancing,' is to be extracted from vectantur, or else secuta stands ior
,semtafum't or sit =ssquatur.

13. missis, sor the more usual immissis, of the reins shaken
loose upon the horses’ necks to urge them on. Thus immissis isaie-
nis Virg. Aen. 5. 6623 immissis frenis id. 11. 889: the horses
themselves are immissi Cic. Fam. 10. 30. 3, etc.

112 me goes both with missis and certatis, of the goul or object
aimed at. Keatslikensapoettoacharioteerinhis‘SleepandPoetry:’
For lo! I see asar

O’ersailing tic blus cragginess, a car
And stscds with streamy manes-tiu charisimi
Looks out upon tite winds with glorious sear:
. , Most amfully intent
The drimr of those stceds' is forwerci beni.

14. currere lata, a rather harsh Greecism: ‘broad in the ³
running) Cp. note on a. 13. 28. The peculiarityhere rs that the noun
agreeing with the adjective could not be (as usual) the subject of the
verb. It is the same kind of harshness to say via currit as pagina
detulit opus below, l. 18. Currere might possibly also be taken as
prolative of the whole sentence, instead of with lata only. There is
no broad-running road, no ‘royal road‚'‘to the Muses. Pinder says
that two constructions are mixed up here, mn datur ad musas lata
via, and non datur currere lata via (ablativa). What does this
mean? Is it not like saying that ⁴ lata should be in the ablative¹ only
it wouldn't scanl’

16. Here again we have the usual prophecy that Augustus will
extend the R'oman empire to the eastern confines of Parthia. See
