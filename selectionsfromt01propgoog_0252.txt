I. 8.

Tffls poem is addressed to Cynthia, and consists os two parts.
In the first part—ll. 1-26-the poet writes in an agony of terror that
she has transferred her affections to a rival who was at that time
praetor designate, and in the belief that she had actually made up
her mind to leave Rome and sail with him to the province ol Illyri-
cum and Dalmatia, of which he had been appointed governor. Ii
the project was indeed entertained, Cynthia was diverted from it by
the indignant and beart-broken remonstrances of Propertius, and he
writes the second part in a tone oi enraptured triumph, assured that
he has won the love oi Cynthia, and attributing the hold he has
acquired over her to his gift os poesy. We hear again of this same
praetor on his return from Illyria in 3. 7. 1, when he is stillan object
of suspicion ; in l. 8 Propertius gives vent to his seelings by calling
him stolidum pecus, ¹ a dull sheep!

l. icitur, with a question, expresses surprise and indignation,=
marking an abrupt conclusion to a lost train oi argument. So Hor.
