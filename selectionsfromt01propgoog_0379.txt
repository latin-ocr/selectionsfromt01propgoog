312 > NOTES.

50. augusto is the dative, going with prccrm diem. But the
conjunction of the name with salvatis intended to indicate that
Augustus was the saviour. ¹

51. timidi. The Nile shrinks now in terror before Augustus,

, ln contrast to the threats which it vuttered before his victory, l. 4²·
vaga, as already noted, is used frequently in a bad sense. It
may refer here to the many mouths of the Nile, or to its inundations,
when it spreads over country not its own. Vagus has frequently
the sense of irregular action, beyond a thing's proper sphere. Thus
it is used of a mast nnstepped (Cat), of a foot in too biga shoe
(Hon), of the Tiber beyond his banks, Hor. 0d. 1. 2. 18.

53. amnti spectavit. Propertius does not observe the usual
rnle of Latin prosody, which does not tolerate a short final syllable
before words beginning with sc, sp, st, sq. Thus he has beni sporn
debant 4. 1. 41 ; consuluitquel striges 4 5. 17.

vectavit, read by Per„ seems here to be the true reading.
spectavi cannot be satisfactorily explained. 1t could only refer to
seeing in imagination‚ or to some representation of Cleopatra.
Possibly, as Pinder suggests, that carried in Augustus’ triurnph.

54. sopor-11 lter, like mortis iter 3. 7. 2 and fortunae auximus - -

uias id. 3²·

trahere is difficolt. lt seems to mean ‘saw her limbs dragging
along the secret path ‘of death' In that case trahere iter would be
like rapere, vorare, viam, eto, bnt denotingslmu and painfnl progress.

55. hoc . . .tanto . . . eive, ablativa absolute, or ablative of
circumstance. ‘So longas thou possessedst so great a citizen as he.’

cive. Augustus specially studied to be ciuilis in his behaviour,
and his civile ingenium was especially contrasted with the reserve
and hauteur of Tiberius.

56. et . . . unm, ‘nor yet that tongue,' i. e. Antony. Horace
speaks of Cleopatra‘s excesses Od. 1. 37. 14 ‘

Mentcmqus lymphatam Mareotico.

57. toto. N. has toto here, and is probably right. Tnere is
strong evidence that Propertius used the archaia declension of unus,
totus, nullus, etc. Nullan curae occurs 1. 20. 35 in the dative,
and uno in 2. 1. 47. It is to be noted that we often find analogice
for Propertius’ archaia usages in Plautus, who was, as Professor
Palmer reminds me, Propertius' fellow-countryman.

58. timuit territa, pleonastic.

Baete. ‘in war.’ Ι

59. Here follows a list of famous Roman exploits‚ introduced
for the purpose of declaring that they are all thrown into the shade
by Augustus’ victory at Actium.
