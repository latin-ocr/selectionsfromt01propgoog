repleverit. The sense points to the successful performance of
the hopeless task, and therefore the future perfect is the appropriate
tense to use, while the simple future is used in 11. 65, 66, 69 and 70.

71. reposcent. The prefix reis used here, as in many other
. words, not to denote restitution, bnt that the thing is suitable,
natural, or due. Poscent would be a demand which might have no

justification; rqtoseent implies a natural, proper, inevitable demand. ’

‘When they shall come¹ to ask,' ‘When in the due course of things
they shall ask,' etc. Cp. Juv. 3. ror, of the roof,

Again, a held is said reddere fructum, not because it gives back the
seed put into it, or makes a return, bnt because ‘it duly yields.'
72. breve in exiguo. Note the emphasising of the sense by

the juxtaposition of two words of similar meaning, cp. Hor. Od. „

73. A difficult line. The text gives spes, the reading of N;
but I believe that pars, the reading of G, should be adopted.
Whether we read spes or pars, the meaning of invidiosa will be
the same, ‘full of the envy of others,¹ ‘the object of envy‚’ i. e. the
word is used objectively‚ not, as more usual, subjectively, in the sense
of ‘ full of enyy towards others.’ If we read spes, then nostrae must

styles Maecenas the hope of his youthful fortunes‚ adding that his
expectations from Maecenas have made him the object of envy..
Literally the words will mean, ‘Thou euvyattracting hope of my
youth,' The phrase is strained and ungainly in itself; but the idea
also is out of place. The poet has declared that his wound cannot
be healed, and, anticipating an early death, calls on Maecenas, his.
chief boast and pride, in life and death alike. to linger one moment
at his tomb, and let fall the, words, ‘Died of unrequited love-⁸
The idea of hope is foreign to the passage. The poet’s racc is run ;,
he only begs that the one great pride of his life—his connection with
Maecenas—a connection which has brought envy on himin the

say one word of sympathy over his grave. Hertzberg and Paley‚
reading pars, take nostrae iuventae to signify ‘our Roman youth,'
quoting the well-known phrase princeps iuventutis, applied to the
young Caesars, and Horace's Maecenas equitum decus. Hertzberg
also laborionsly shows that Maecenas might come under the Roman
