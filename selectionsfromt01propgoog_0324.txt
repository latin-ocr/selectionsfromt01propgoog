PROPERTIUS, ΙΙ. 31, 7-163 111, 1. 257

III. 1.

ΙΝ this Elegy Propertius asserts his claims as a poet, acknow-
ledges his masters and‘ his models, proelaims his originality, and
declares that after death his fame will rise triumphant out of all
the attacks of his detractore It is interesting tc compare it with
Hor. Od. 4 3, which is one of Horace’s most artistic Odes, and is
devoted to the same subject. Many of the same ideas run through
both pieces‚ though the manner of working them in, and the
tone and temper of the two poema, are very different. Thereis in
the Horatian poem a sense of power, a calm dignity and seli-
restraint, a simplicity and faithfulness to fact, an absence of self even
when speaking of self, a true conception of what makes the poet
and what the poet is, lastly a teuder music running through the
whole piece, which stamp it as the work of true poetic genius.
We have in the Horatian Ode, as in the Propertian, the idea of the
triumph of the chamot-racc, of the intluences which mould the
poetic faculty, of the detracting work of envy, of the certainty of '
Rome'a approving verdict; but Horace has the consummate art tc
put every idea in its right place, and give it its importance vvith
reference to the whole3 he speaks with the simplicity and modesty
of true greatness, and proves his right to fame by the very manner
of his renounciug it. Propertius is somewhat fussy ln his sels·
assertion ; he pushes his rivals mdely by; he does not observe a
due order in his ideas, but proclaims his triumph first, records the
⁶ grounds for it afterwards, and acknowledges lastly that, after all, it
has not been yet awarded to him: he acquaints us with the source
of his inspiraticn before he has made us feel that he is inspired,
whereas Horace lira makes us feel that heisa poet, and not till
then does he tell us that all his merit is the Muse's gift. Lastly, while
Propertius has to glorify his models tf he would exalt the copyist,
and looks to such frigid sources of inspiration as Muses’ grottoes
and Muses’ inspiring founts, Horace appeals to Nature as the true
fashicner cf poets in those noble and tuneful words which Words-
worth might fain have written:

Sed quae Tibur aquae fertile praefluunt,
Et spissae nemomm comae,
Fingcnt Aeolio carmine mbilcm.

1-4. Addressing the shades of Callimachus and Philetas, the

poet prays for admission to their sacred grove: then assuming that
his prayer is granted, he claims to bc the first inspired bard who
has wedded the rites of Italy to the song of Graece. callimachus
