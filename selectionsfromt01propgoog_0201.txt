expression Aen. 1. 8, also in reference 'to Juno; quo nunrine laeso,
'at what point, in what respect, was her divinity outraged that!

82. lentae . . . mutatas, i. e. wished that my campaign might
be spun out so as to keep me away from Delia.

84. anua. From 1. 6. 57 it would seem that the ducnna who
is to keep guard over Delia, tell her stories, and set her aspinning,
was her mother: otherwise the unceremonious way in which she is
spoken of might lead us to surmise that she was the counterpart of
’ the modern nurse, developed into a lady companion.

' 85. poema. Ponere is specially used of setting down things
on a table: ol a lamp or candle, therefore, it is equivalent to our
phrase ‘to bring in’ lights: of a dish put down at a meal, it means
‘to serve upls Thus Pers. 1. 53 Calidum scis ponere sumen, ‘you
know how to serve up a sow's paunch piping hot.'

’ 86, Deducat, ‘to draw out,’ the regular word used of spin-
ning, and so often used metaphorically of the drawing out or
spinning of verses. See Prop.1.16-. 41. We leam from various
passages, e. g. Ov. Met. 4. 32-45, that the correct way ol spending
the evening for the female part of an ancient household was to be
busy with spinning or.weaving, while one of the party would tell s
’ s'tories. ¹Cp. the well known story of Lucretia, Liv. 1. 5„ Ov. Fast. '7'

87. oiroa is peculiar, used of a single puellas Yet we speak
of one person being always ‘about' another, meaning ‘in their
company.' Puella can scarcely stand for ‘a grou-p of maidens?

91. quau· erte, ⁴ just as you arel without making any change
on my account. Ut cras is frequently used in the same way3 Ov.

Met· 4· 473
Tisiphone canos, ut erat, turbata capillos.

92. nudato, i. e. ‘without taking time to put on your shoes.' '

93. huno illum. This phrase well illustratos the meaning ol
these two pronouns. Illum is ‘that distant. much-hoped for, ¹
glorious day, when 1 shall returp to you;' hunc (which contains
the predicate of the sentence) means ‘just such a day as I ha've
now described? The meaning then is ‘may that glorious day when
it comes be like this,’ ‘such be that day!
