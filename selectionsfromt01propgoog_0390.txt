111. 22.

THIS poem may be read in conjunction with 1. 6. They are both
addressed to the poet's friend, Tullus, wh0‚ at the time of the
writing oi that poem, was setting out ior Asia in the suite of an
uncle, and had apparently asked Propertius to accompany hlm.
The poet declined the invitation, declaring that he had no taste sor
war, and that he would rather stay at home to enjoy Cynthia's love
than see all the sights of the East, The uncle is generally supposed
to have been L. Volcatius Tullus, who was consul along with
Augustus in Β. e. 33, aud was son of the L. Volcatius Tullus, consul
tac. 66, best known as furnishing a date to Horace's winejar, Od.

3. 8¹ 12 Anphorae sumum bibere institutae

Consule Tullo.

Volcatius was setting out for his provincial command in Asia when
1. 6 was written, and the poet had the opportunity of joining his
snite as Tibullus joined that· of Messala, and Catullus that of
Memmius. How much Propertius lost by the refusal may be
measured by what we have gained from the charm and interest
thrown into the lives and writings ol his fellowpoets by their travels
in the East, In the present poem, Propertius complains that his
friend has stayedaway too long, and assureshimthatwhatevermarvels ¹
there may be in the East, there is, aiter all, no country like Italy,

Ι which contains within herself all the charms and wonders of all

other countries. Closely parallel are Hor. Od. 1. 7 aud the well·
known praises of Italy in Virg. Geo. a. 136-176. As to the date oi
this poem, we find from l.1 that Tullus has lor many years (multos
annos) had Cyzicus as his headquarters. When did he go outl
Volcatius was consul in nc. 33, and, according to the rule estab-
lished by the Senate in Β. e. 52, no consul or praetor could enter
upon his provincial command until five years had elapsed from his
tenure of office in the city. 1f this mle was observed‚ we may
suppose that Volcatius did not go to Asia until lac. 27. That
would fix the date os 1. 6: and this piece must have been written
some years (multos annos) afterwards. ⁴
