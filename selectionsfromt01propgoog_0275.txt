208 “ NOTES.

” ‘Not there-even in that land of darkness—could Protesilaus:
etc· 9. cupidus goes with Phylacides, l. 7, and Thessalis umbra
is the predicate: ‘He came in the character oi a shade?

falsis goes primarily with palmis. Just as gaudia were called
falsa in 1. 8. 29 because there was no solid ground ior their exist·

ence,' so here the hands are falsae because unsubstantial. But a
reference to that line will show that the 'idea of falsis is intended to
be thrown over gaudia as well as palmis:

Falsa licat cupidus deponat gaudio livor.-
xThe recurrence of the three words fizlso, cupidus, gaudia can
scarcely be accidental.

11. imago. Pinder suggests an allusion to the ‘image’ of
Protesilaus, which Laodamia made and worshipped after his second
death. .

tua dicar imago. It is hard to determine whether the pre-
dicate of the sentence be tua imago or tua only. In the latter
case, imago will mean only a shade: ‘Shade though I be,' or ‘In
my phantom form I shall still be called thina! In the former ease,
imago must have some further meaning, ‘I shall be called thy
semblance or representative.' ‘I shall be held to present thy sorm,'
i. e. not merely that he would be known as a shade to be still
devoted to her, but that he was so identified with her. their per-
sonalities were so joined together, that his shade would be said to be
nothis only but hers alsa.

dicar. In accordance with his usual tendency, Propertius pre-
sers to say ‘ I shall be called thine,' than simply ‘I shall be thine’

12. ararath, in its intransitive sense. ‘passes the bounds of
Fate,’ ie. of Death. Traicere is also used transitively when
it may be constructed with two Accusatives‚ one of the object
crossed, the other of the thing sent across it. Thus Caesar B. G. 1. 83
Caesar Germanos flumen traicit. ‘sends the Gemnans across the
rrver.’

fati rurore. Cp. una ratis fati a. 28. 39.

magnus amor. The epithet is either specific‚ ‘A potent
love' or general, ‘The mighty power of Love.’

With this magnificent line—read in connection'with ll.18-ao-
cp. Byron, who thus speaks of a love severed by death:
Yet did! love thoe to the lost
As faroandy as thou,
Who didst not chorago through all the part,
And can'st root altar nom.
