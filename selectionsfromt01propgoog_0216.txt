54„ Liba. The libum was a cake much used' 1n sacrifices; it
was made os cheese, wheaten flour, and an egg. Cato, R. R. 75,
gives a minute receipt for making it. When there was any feast in

generals to whom he accorded triumphs, who were to defray the
expense out of their spoils, Suet. Oct. 5ο. Messalla, being amongst
the number, had to repair the Via Latino, one of the two main
roads to the South. stasing from the Porta Capena,·like the Via
Appia, it diverged from it almost immediately to the left or North,
and making straight for the northern shoulder of the Alban gronp,
passed close to Tuscul lum ,leaving the Alban mount upon the right,

Thence descending the Trerus and the Liris, it ultimately joined the
Via Appsaat Beneventum To thrs road probably Mart alludes8. 5. 5

Et quum rupta situ Messallae saxa iacebunt.
