PROPERTJUS, 11. 1.‚ 7-26. 217

Ephialtes, sons of Aloeus (hence called the Aloidae), to scale the
heavens by piling the three mountains here mentioned upon each
other. Propertius avoids the error os Virgil, according to which
Olympus, the biggest of the three mountains, is placed upon the
top: Geo. 1. 281

Ter sunt conati imponere Pelio Ossam,

Scilicet, atque Ossae frondoium involvere Olympium.

' See Ramsay's Extracts from Ovid, p. 246. Here Olympus is placed

at the bottom, and Pelion on top of Ossa.

20. ut, connected with impositam, as though that word had
ita before it: ‘Ossa so placed on Olympus that Pelion was the way
to heaven,' i. e. was placed on the top. Some MSS. read impositum,
but Ossa is feminine in Ov. Am. π. 1. 14.

22. The reference apparently is to the cutting through of the
isthmus of Mount Athos, by which ‘two seas’ could be said to have
‘come together! Juvenal sceptically allodes to this undoubted

aehievement, επ· 10. ¹74 Creditur olim

Velificatus Athos, ct quidquid Graecia mendax
Audet irs historia.

'lhe gigantic work—of which traces still exist-employed a vast
multitude of men, and took three years to execute. But it is not
impossible that the words may refer to the bridging of the Hellespont,
which made the two continents one, and therefore appealed more
to the imagination than the much greater, though useless, work oi
cutting through the isthmus of Mount Athos. Vadam is used strictly
of shallow water, the water close to the shore. Thus, with reference
to a swimmer's danger, we have the proverb, Omnis res est iam in
vado, ‘All is now safe’ Bina coisse vado might therefore refer to ‘
the shore-wasers of the two continents joined together by the bridge.

24. The allusion of course is to the magnificent victory of
Marius over the Cimbri at Campi Raudii, near Vercellae, in his fifth
consulship, rac. 101.

benoncia, ‘the splendid exploits,‘ should perhaps be written in
two words, as in the line quoted by Cic. a. 18. 62 from Ennius:

Bene sacto male locata mole sacta arbitror.

25. res, in contrast to bello, would seem to denote the political
achievements of Augustus.

26. cura, ‘the object of my attention,' ‘oi my song' Cura
is often used specially of love, as Prop. 1. 15. 31 tua sub nostro . ..
pectore curo, audeo of a loved object, as in Virg. E. 10. υ tuo cura
Lycoris.
