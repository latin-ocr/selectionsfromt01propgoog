sinonem, 11. 5, 3-25. 167

Janus, introduced agriculture, wealth (his wife was called Ops), and '

the civilised arts of life, and settled on the banks of the Tiber on the
height originally called Saturnia, subsequently known as the Capi-
tolium. This account is given in detail by Virgil, Aen. 8. 314 sqq.
and 355, where Saturnus is represented as coming direct from
Olympus alter his defeat by Jupiter The one intelligible connec-
tion between the two is that Hesiod, Op 111, tells ns that the
golden age on earth was while Kronos ruled' ιιι heaven: an Ιἰιιεει
which exactly fitted· ιιι with the ltalian idea of Saturnus, a god of
peace and plenty,' ιιι whose days war and greed aud wrong were
alike unknown.

Hexameters. They were in Greek.

19. The commentators have no reason for imagining aresponse
