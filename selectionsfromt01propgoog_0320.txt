verse or verses ;- bnt where is the offering here? After puella in
l. 44, dedicauit hoc munus is clearly understood: where and what is
the munus? Arethusa, in 4.Ι 3. 71, dedicates her husband's arms
and writes the carmen under them:
Armaque aum tulero portae votiva Capenae,
Subscribam ‘salvo grata puella vira’

’ It is probable‚ therefore, that some sacred gift is referred to in l. 43,
for which Propertius wasto write an inscription. The words per
magnum salva maella Iovem seem too insignificant for an offering by
themselves. ‘Operosum sane carmen 1⁶ is Palmer's note: bnt it is not
clear what he means when he adds ‘sacro crimine damnatus idem
significat atque illud “voti reus.’'’ What is the force of crimine?
A gift or vow of some sort is no doubt implied, for which Proper-
tius was to write an inscription: the gift might be trivial, but to
Propertius the important thing was that he was to write the verses,
and so he mentions them only, saying nothing about the offering.

Aritium. Iope, usually known by the longer form of the name as
Cassiopeia, was daughter of Aeolus, wife of Cepheus, and mother of

roused the anger of the Nereids by boasting of her own beauty as
surpassing theirs.
