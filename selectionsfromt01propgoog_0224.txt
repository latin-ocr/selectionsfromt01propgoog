T IBULLUS, 1. 10, 68—11. 1. ’ 157

Cui tu laete savos et miti dilue Baccho,

Terque nouas circum felix eat hostia fruges,

Omnis quam chorus et sarii comitentur maestes,

Et Cererem clamore vacent iu tecta ; neque ante

Faleem maturis quisquam supponat aristis,

Quam Cereri, tarta redimitus tempora quercu,

Det motus imompasitos et earmina dicat.
Cato (R.,R. 141) gives, at length, the form of prayer most fitting
for such occasions.

¹ Besides the Ambarvalia, celebrated by private individuals or small
communities, there was a public festival, whose name and object were
· the same, in which the sacred rites were performed by a college of
priests, denominated the Fratres Arvales. These, according to
tradition, were first instituted by Romulus, and, originally, it was their
duty to march in solemn processioa round the boundaries of the
state, accompauied hythe victims-a baar, a ram, and a bull-con-
stitutiug the sacrifice called Suovetaurilia, singing hymus us they
paced along. When, in later times. from the extension os territory, '
this became impossible, the sacrifices were still offered at certain
spots which marked the original limits of the Roman domain¹.'
The only clue as to the date is given in l. 33, in which Messalla's

Aquitanian triumph is alluded to. The poem must therefore have
been composed after that event, uot earlier thau the spring os ’

u. c. 26. The interest of the piece is great, as it is nota mere theo· '' Χ 1
retical description, but au account of the ceremony which he was him· ’

sclf about to celebrate on his own farm, as an act of regular worship.

The shortness of the Second Book of Tibullus' Elegies has been
explained by the supposition that the poems contained in it were
collected and published after his death. Ovid, however, must have ’
known of the book before he wrote the elegy on the death of
Tibullus, and some time before he wrote Α. Α. 3. 535 =

Nos saciatus placitae late praeconia formae:
Nomen habet Nemesis, Cynthia nomeu habet.

1. Α. and most MSS. have valeat: but faveat is a certain
correction. Tibullus uses the regular formula with which a sacrifice
or any holy rite was opeued, as linguisque animisque favete Ov.
Met. 15. 677. Ill-omened words must be avoided on such oc·
essions3 and as the only mode of securing that no ill-omeued words
should be pronounced was that no words should beuttered stall,
the phrase favete linguis is equivalent to ‘keep silence?
