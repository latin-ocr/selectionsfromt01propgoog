Prop. 3. 19. aa, where Scylla, who caused her father's death aud

39. renen. The name of Perseus naturally suggests that of
his conqueror, and rs used here for 1t.

These two lines have been much canvassed. They coutain a
reference to L. Aemilius Paullus Macedonicus, the conqueror of Per-
seus: by an inversion characteristic of Propertius, he makes Cornelia
appeal first to Perseus himself (l. 39), whose name suggests naturally
that of Paullus3 then in l 40, addressing Perseus. he specifically de-
scribes hrs conqueror ‘Iappeal to Perseus too, him that boasted
all the bravery of his ιιιιοεεῒοιΙΑιιῙιίΗει and him too who broke
down thy house, Perseus, for all thy boasts ιιι thine aucoetor
Achilles! The repetition 01 Achilles' ιι strongly ironical: Perseus
and other members of the Macedonian house were for ever boasting
01 their desceut from him, aeternus carmine Achilles Sil. Ital.
14. 95. Another explanation is to make Persen govemed by fregit:
‘him who broke Perseus, and thy house Perseus) but this is harsh
aud gives less excuse for the tuas. Icannot follow Mr. Postgate.
Because Silius Italicus hus the word stimulos in one passage
(14. 93) iu connection with Pyrrhus* boastiug in his ancestor
Achilles, and stimulabat iu another (3. 609) quite uncouuected with
Achilles3 because in a third (15. 292) proavo tumebat Achilli is
said 01 Philip; and in a fourth (3. 246) monocordo tumore is applied
to a man proud of being Hannibal's nephew: therefore he holds it
clear that Silius Italicus had this passage 01 Propertius before him,
aud that tumidos (or cognate word) aud stimulantem were read in the
copy which he followed. In these passages the words stimulos
tumore, etc. occur in a perfectly natural way, and Silius had uo need
to be guided to their use. But Postgate is entirely right in rejecting
the rash changes proposed by H. A. J. Mauro, Journal 01 Philo-
logy, 6. pp. 5 3-62 ‚ aud in condemning his sweeping dictum that ‘the
Latin lauguage peremptorily forbids that simulantem cau mean “who
formerly affected.''' The use 01 the present participle is merely an
extensiou of the use of the present for the past tense noticed on 3. 7.
ιι. Cp. Virg. Aen. 9. 266 quem dat Sidonia Dido. Simulantem
gives an abiding characteristic of the man, almost equivalent to
simulatorem, ‘the pretender to.' Cp. also tondens 3. 19. ra‚fugiens
4. 6. 15, and the present nutrit 4. 4. 54. A still closer parallel is
Tac. Anu. 1-13 (quoted above), where Augustus describes M.
Lepidus as being capacem sed aspernantem.
