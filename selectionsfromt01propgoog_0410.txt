PROPERTIUS‚ 1v. 4., 15-41. 343

30. non perronna The poet glauces at her future punishment.

31. Paley says the speech of Tarpeia cannot extend to l. 66,
because flevit is inappropriate to the passage from l. 48. But it is
clear the whole is spoken by Tarpeia. She begins ll. 31-46 bya
soliloquy: she then, ll. 47—66, goes on as if she were addressing
Tatius, and discloses to him her plan.

34. Dum . . . conspicer, ‘Provided only 1 may gaze on?

85. montibus addita Roma. Addita is used here in a
pregnant sense, to give the idea that Rome was something far greater
than the site on which she stood. So iu a bad sense, ‘inflicted upon,’
Teucris addita Iuno Virg. Aen. 6. 90 and Luc. ap. Macr. 5. 6. 4

Si milri non praetor sict additus atque agitet me.
Paley feebly explains ‘the buildings add to the height ol the montes!

36. meat, ‘Farewell to.’ She here meditates merely running
away: the idea of earning her right to be Tatius’ wife by treachery
has not yet suggested itself.

pacanda, notin its usual‘sense, ‘whom I ought to be ashamed
of ’ (Pal), but ‘before whom I ought to feel shame.'

37, 38. Her mind reverts to the dazzling apparition of Tatius
on his horse :¹ a confirmation of frena in l. 20.

37. meon amores is generally held to refer to Tarpeia herself,
‘my loving self,' just as in 2. 13. 22 mors mea=ego mortuus, and in
3. 5. 4 nostra sitis=ego sitiens But Palmer is doubtless right in
supposing it refers to Tatius: ‘my love,' ‘ my darling' So in 2. 28. 39,
of C thia

yn Una ratis fati nostros portabit amores.

Tarpeia is recalling in a hopeless dreamy way the vision of Tatius
on horseback; she envies the horse his privilege of carrying his rider
back to the oamp3 and theu recounts with a half-approval instances
of maidens who have been urged to bold wicked deeds by the urgency
of their passion. lt would be quite out of place for her, at this stage,
to contemplate calmly a successful elopement.

39, 40. Like Virgil, E. 6. 74, and Ovid, Fast. 4. 500, Pro·
pertius confounds Scylla the daughter of Nisus, king of Megara,
with the sea-monster of Homer and later tradition, who lived on
the Italian side of the Struits of Messius. The former betrayed ‘her
father and her country to Minos, king of Crete, by cutting off a cer·
tain purple lock of her father's hair. See Aesch. Cho. 615, Pausan.
Att. 1. 19. 5' (Paley). Thus Prop. 3. 19. 21

Teque o Minoa venumdata, Scylla, figura,
T evidens purpurea regna patema coma.
41. l’rodita . . . mamni cornua monstrt, lit. ‘The betrayed
