PROPERTIUS,1. 8., 45-14., 1-5. 197

3. 22 the poet writes to him upbraiding him with his long absence, as
showing indifferenoe to his friends and the beauties of his own
country. The First Elegy of the First Book, in which Propertius
declares his absolute devotion to Cynthia, is also addressed to Tullus:
and it is highly probable that it was through Tullus that the poet
first obtained an introduction to Maecenas.

1. ¹211, in antithesis to meo amori in l. 7.

abiectus. This word usually carries with it the idea of despond-
ency or meanness, as in its English equivalent3 but here it is to be
taken simply in the sense of ‘stretched at ease,’ ‘lying prostrate,’ in
connection with the local ablative tiberina anda. Cp. Or. Her.

Kentoreo. Mentor was the ¹most celebrated chaser of silver
among the Greeks, especially famous for his cups. He lived shortly
before 3 56 uc, as we are told that many of his cups were destroyed
in the buming of the temple of Ephesus in that year. Enormous
prices were paid lor his works: Juvenal 8. 104 describes the wealthy

days of the East by asserting

rarae sine Mentore mensae ,·
and Martial 4 39. 5 thus addresses a wealthy connoisseur:
Solus Mentoreos habes labores.

3, 4. Tullus lies lazily stretched upon the river bank, watching
the barges gliding down the current or being towed against it.

5. intendat veruca silvae. This phrase has been strangely
