The Triumphal Procession entered the city from the Campus Martius,
where it was marshalled by the Parta Triumphalis (close to the
river, used only on such occasions), made the entire circuit, or more
strictly a three-quarter circuit, of the Palatina passing through the
Circus in its course. On reaching the summit of the Velia-where
now stands the Arch of Titus—it descended into the Forum · by the
Via Sacra, having now the Capitol full in iront.

camrem in l. 31. Somewhat similar isVirg. Aen, 8. 656, of the goose,

Gallos in limine adesse canebat. ¹

It would hence appear that the prows of the ships conquered at
Actium were carried in the triumphal processioa.

35. The art of the poetis here compared to that of wearing, as
it so often is to that of spinning. In the latter case the idea seems
to be simply that oi drawing out verses like a thread or ‘line,' as in
Hor. Epp. a. 1. aa 5 tenui deducta poematafilo, and Prop. 1. 16. 41

At tibi saepe navo deduxi carmina versu.

In the former case the idea is that of composition as a whole, as
Seu. Epp, 114 18 contexere liberem. Quint. 9. 4. 19 distinguishes an
oratio vincta atque contexta from one solnta, i.e. ‘compact' ‘well
put together) Cp. our word ‘context’ Here the idea is that the
name of Maecenas would necessarily be woven into-bound up with
-any account of Caesar's exploits.

36. There ia nothing in the words sumpta et posita pace to sug-
gest the idea that Maecenas actually took part in any os Augnstns'
campaigns. There is every reason to believe he did not: though
Hor, Epod. 1. 1. 8 shows that Maecenas had contemplated taking
part in that of Actium.

adolescant. There is tendemess, as well as praise, in these
words. It is instructive to note the difference between the Latin
and English uses oi the words ‘head’ and ‘beart‘ The ancients
believed the heart to be the seat of intelligence: hence Pers. 6.10
Cor jubet hoc Enni, in imitation oi Lucilius’ Egregie cordatus nomo,
who meant that Ennius was a man of genius, i. e. ‘ had a good head?
Caput, on the other hand, denoted primarily the physical lise: to

expose the capnt to peril was to expose the life, or as we should
