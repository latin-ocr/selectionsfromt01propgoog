238 NOTES.

modern fashion in cemeteries. Hence the frequent invocatione to
travellers to stop their chariots (2. 1. 75) or their horses to pay a
tribute of respect to the dead—invocations often senselessly repeated
on modern tombstones. No man could approach the Etemal City
bnt through this City of the Dead: and it must have affordeda
strange sensation to the traveller visiting Rome for the first time to
have to pass for miles and miles, before the city itself was in view,
between two lines of the ancient dead, each tomb telling in simple Ι
words the story of the occupants,and, as a rnle, surmonnted with

and explains the meaning of the symbols under which the god was
represented. The subject was a common one for decorative and
other purposes; and as it was essential foran ancient artist to adhere

knows how to handle a horse’s mouth. Analogous is the phrase ‘ a
good tonch,’ applied to manual performance on musical instruments.

3. 1⁸, referring to the same person as ille, line 1.

nine sensu, as nearly as possible equivalent to ‘without sense'
The word sensus here has no technical meaning: it does not mean,
as often elsewhere, either ‘ sensation' or ‘sensibility‚' which it would
be absnrd to deny to lovers, or ‘perception‘ as Postgate says (‘ to
lie in insemibility, without perceiving obvious facts '); it means just
