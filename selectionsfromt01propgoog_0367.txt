300 nores,

points out, properly means ‘changing colour,' like bur word ‘shot’
as applied to silk.

51. Propertius now paints the painsul details of the death. The
human neiis, which are continuous with, and a modification of, the
scarf skin, will drop off with the scari skin after two or three days'
immersion in water, especially if the temperature be warm. Post-
gate says Propertius knew this, and imagined the same thing might
happen during life from the mere force of the waves. Paley sup
poses the meaning to be that Paetus ‘could not swim effectively
because his hands were hurt‘ It seems simpler to suppose that
what Propertius meant was that the nails were torn off by the violent
dashing oi the body by the waves against the rocky bottom. Vivos
is better than vivo, which is weak, and was probably suggested by
huic.

52. miser musam express the horror os the moment; traxit,
the' long deep draught. mser hiatus=miser hiante ore.

53. improba, one oi the most difficult of Latin words to trans·
late. As probus is constantly joined with pudicus, of a slave, to denote
well-regulated, respectsul conduct, so improbus almost always im-
plies some torm of cxcess, in a culpable direction, with its correlative,
in a human subject, ol effrontery. Thus improbus anser Virg. Geo.
1. 119, is ‘the greedy goose3' labar improbus id. 1. 146, is ‘excessua'
‘unceasing labour‚' ‘that knows no rest;' inprobus iste Dares
Virg. Aen. 5. 397, ‘yon braggart‡;’ improba ventris rabies id. a. 357,
‘ravening hunger' (Machail translates ‘mad malice of hunger,'
quite wrong) ; Improbe Amor id. 4. 412, of the reckless audacityof
Love (Mackail ‘injurious‚’ wrong again) ; ingenti fruor improboque

somno, ‘unconscionable,' Mart. 12. 18.13; negat improbus Hor. Epp. ¹
1. 7. 63, ‘the impudent scoundreL' The word may often be well ³
rendered by ‘bold' Here the idea is that night adds a new horror ’

to the situation, as if it were not terrible enough already. ‘Cruely'
perhaps brings this meaning ont better than ‘pitiless’ (Post).

54. nt occideret.. . coiere, ‘came together to‚’ ‘combined
for‚’ the loss of'Paetus. ,

55. Heus, in the extremity ol his sear. The ancients thought
it natural to weep in moments of danger. An Italian boatmun
caught in a squall will resort to tears and the saints for safety,
instead oi paying out the sheet. Cp. siccis oculis Hor. Od. 1. 3. 18.
See Prop. 2. 27. 7, with Postgate's note.

56. niger, in reference to nox improba l. 53.

clauderet ora, lit. ‘shut his mouth‚‘ to use our own colloquial

expression.
