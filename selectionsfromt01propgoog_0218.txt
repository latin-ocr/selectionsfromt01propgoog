before which Horace ran, having ‘ ingloriously thrown his shield away ;'
but had he taken part in so memorable a campaign, his writings
would surely have borne some trace of it The circumstance too that

“ he was shorn of part of his ancestral property is an indication that ’

he was not considered to be an adherent of the triumvirs; unless
indeed we regard the fact that he was allowed to keep a portion of
it as a mark of especial favour, whilst opponents like Horace, or
neutrals like virgil, lost their all. It is to be noted that in this
poem Delia has not yet appeared upon the scene; the poet looks
sorward ia hope to the simple pleasures of the country, and the
sweets of domestic llfe; but there is no parting to look back to, as
in 1. 3, no loved oue to whose arms he hopes to return.

what abrupt to say, ‘ But he, poor wretch, did no harm: ours is the
blame? With an the transition is softened: ‘Or is it rather true
to say that ours is the blame, not hisl’

5, 6. Note the distinction between ad and in when followed by
accusatives. Ad is vague, of general direction, without purpose; ι
in is followed by the immediate, seen, object of a hostile attaek.

7. He returns to the theme of 1. 1, that lust for gold is the
cause of war.
