15⁶ Ι noras,

himself male sobrias, it is to be hoped that his wife, or some other
member of the family, held the relus.

mala sobrius, i. e, ‘by no means sober‚' ‘very drnnk? The
use of the adverb male is apt to embarrass the young scholar, when
he finds that it apparently bears two opposite meanings. Thus '
male saraam Cic. Att. 9. 15, is equivalent to ‘not at all sane' or
‘insane ;' whereas mm dubita quin me mala oderat, Cic. Att. 14
1. a, means ‘he hates me very much ;' male metuo, Ter. Hec. 3. 2. ⁵
a, ‘ Ι am very much afraid3’ male laxus calceus, Hor. Sat. 1. 3. 21,
‘a very loose shoe.’ The explanation is that male, like our ‘ badly,’
naturally varies iu meaning according to the meaning ol the word to
which it is joined. ‘To be badly wounded’ is to be very much
wounded, because wouuding is an undesirable‚ evil thing. But ‘to
fit badly' is to fit not at all, because fitting is the thing desired, and
to add ⁴ badly’ implies that the object is imperfectly attained or not
attained at all. So with male: malesanus, ‘badly sane.' ue. ‘not
sane3' cp. singers male rauci Hor. Sat, 1. 4. 66, ‘very hoarse‚‘
because hoarseuess is a bad thing. To do a baal thing badly is to do
it very badly ; to do a good thing badly is to do it imperfectly, or
not at all. Cp. our ‘ ill ;' ‘I canili brook,' i. e. ‘scarcely’

68. perfluat. ‘overfl0w.' The idea is taken from representa-
tions of Pax on coins and elsewhere: she holds an ear or ears of
corn in her hand, her lap runs over with apples and other fruit.

‘Tnn subject of this Elegy is the Ambarvalia or Sacram Am·
larvale, a festival celebratedin spring time by the rustic population
of Latium, sor the purification of themselves, their flocks, and fields.
As the name imports, the victims were led round the limita of each
sarm or district, and the holy influence os the sacrifice was sup· ’
posed to extend to everything included within this circle. Such is
the solemnity described by virgil, when he enjoins the husbandmen
to pay due honour to the gods‚⁰Geo. 1. 338

In primis venerare cleas, alque annua magnae
Sacra refer Cereri laetis operatus in herbis,
Extremae rub casum hiemis, r'am vere serena.

T unc pingues agni et tune mollissima vina ,·

T unc somni dulces, densaeque r'n montibus umbrae.
Cuncta tibi Cererem pubes agrestis aderet. ’
