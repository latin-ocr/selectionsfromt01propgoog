stantly couples the two ideas, but in a spirit very different from that
which prompted the words,
· Ι know uat maula usweuer, uo uat I.

17. lcitum ep. agitur in the exactly parallel passage, n. 1. 71
Quandocumque agitur uitam maa sata reposcent.

In both passages a contemplation of his death is made tb follow, 'as
by a natural consequence, upon an emphatic protestation of his love.

18. acta, ‘the arrangements' or ‘dispositions’ for his funeral.
They are called acta, because made, decided upon, during his life.
Postgate well compares the phrase acta Caesaris, which occurs so
often iu Cic. Phil. a, of the various dispositions for the future con·
duct of affairs made (or at least pretended by Antony to have been

made) by Caesar before bis death.
’ 19. He desires no long array of ancestral images to follow him
to the grave—for the very good reason that he had no claim to such
a distinction. All nabiles, i. e. descendants of men who had held
curule office, were allowed to have waxen images orbosts of their
distinguished ancestors ranged round the atrium of the house.
This right was called ius imaginum. ΤῙΊο relationship between
the originals of the busts was indicated by garlands or strings,
stemmata, the prototype of the modern pedigree or genealogical
table. Hence the well-known Stemmata quid faciunt? of Juv.
8.1. At a funeral, these busts‚ which seem to have been hollow,
were put on by persons who represented the dead worthies and who,
wearing the dress and insignia which the dead would have worn,
walked before the bier in long procession to the place of buming or
interment, so that the deceased seemed actually to be escorted to
the grave by the whole series of his ancestors. ln the case of the
older families, these processions must have been extraordinarily im-
posing. In recording the death of Tiberius' son Drusus, Tacitus
himself was moved at the thought of what must have been one of
the most grotesque and yet impressive sights ever witnessed. There
passed forth, says the historian, ‘in long array all the fathers of the
Julian house-Aeneas, all the Alban kings, then the Sabine nobility
with Attus Clausus, and all the rest of the Claudii,' Ann. 4. 9. See
Juv. 8. 2 sqq.; Ov. Fast. 1. 591 ; Hor. Epod. ,8. 12.

imagine, in the singular, as though it were a collective noun.

20. tuba. At the head of the funeral processioa marched
musicians, flate-players‚ homblowers, and trumpeters; hence tuba
sometimes stands for death, as in Pers. 3. 103 '
