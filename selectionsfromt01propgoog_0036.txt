the fourteenth century. It hasbeen corrected by various
hands, but these corrections are all of little or no value.
These two MSS. resemble each other so closely, that
it is evident they are derived from a common archetype.
To this same family belong the various MSS. of the

. . fifteenth century-including those reliedupon by Lach-

mann-which departed more and more widely from the
original, and suffered much from interpolations by Joannes
Aurispa, Thomas Seneca, Jovianus Pontanus, and other
J scholars of that century.

But Baehrens believes that he has lighted upon a MS.
which belongs to a different and older family than A V.
Lachmann set great store by certain readings noted in
1501 by Franciscus Puccius‚ who professed to have de·
rived them from an old MS. This MS. Baehrens believes
he has found in

Gor Codex Guelferbytanus, a folio MS.‚ now at

· Wolfenbiittel, on parchment, which contains the works of
Tibullus on thirty-eight leaves, along with other matter.
The writing is an imitation os the Langobardic character
of the tenth os eleventh century, but Baehrens holds that it
was written about 1425 Α. Ι). It has been corrected by a
later hand, not only on the margin, but between the lines,
and even in the text itself. These corrections are some·
times taken from a MS: of the A V family, but are for the
most part worthless. The text itself, from its similarity to

. the readings of Puccim, Baehrens holds to be the very

MS. used by him : it seems to be derived from a different
original from A V, but to belong to the same family as the

*excerpta Parisina, a book of extracts from various
ancient authors, compiled by some learned Frenchman
between rooo and 1100 A. 1). This collection contained
passages from Tibullus 1 and 11 ε these were seen by vin-
centius Bellovacensis, a writer of the thirteenth century,

and other writers of that time: a copy carne into the '

hands of Scaliger, and Meyncke has collected the pas·
