manu which has been raised in the similar passage, 2. 1. 66. It is
very probable that manu is the dative, and that the scribe has

which makes the dative necessary, and it must be confessed that
apta gives a better meaning than acta. There was nothing specially
shameiul in the manner in which Cleopatra hurled her spear, or in

Rome: what was shameful and humiliating to the Roman feeling
was that a woman should appear in arms against Rome, and herself
take part in the campaign. It was the fact that she bore anns,
that she commanded Romans in a war against Rome, that was in-
tolerable: Hor. Epod. 9. 11-14
Romanus, cheul posteri negabitne,

If femineae manuhe adopted here, we must adopt the dative
