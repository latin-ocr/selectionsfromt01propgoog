27. Rufinam, referring to the outbreak ofcivil war afterCaesar's
murder. The consuls Hirtius and Panse, at the head oi thesenatorial
forces, were both killed in the moment os victory before Mutina in
B. c. 43 ε Ovid marks his birth by that event, Trist. 4. 10. 6

aivum busta rmuppoe. A very harsh apposition, like
patriae sepulcra, Italiae funera in r. 22. 3,4

29. Allnding to the siege of Perusia: see 1. 21. r, and note on

30. rtolemeeei. This seems the proper sorm oi the adjective,
The Latin form os the name is Ptolemaeus, corresponding to the
Greek Πτολεμαΐος; from this the Greek adjective would be Πτολε-
aciatos, which would naturally become Ptolemaeeus in Latin. The
MSS. and edd. vary much, as might be expected.

Pharas is usually feminine, but occurs masculine in Suet. Claud.
20. It is properly the name oi the island still called Faro, opposite
the mouth of the harbour oi Alexandria, on which Ptolemy Phila·
delphus (reigned se. ²85-247) built his famous lighthouse. Caesar
speaks of it with admiration B. C. 3. 112. Hence the word cameto
signiiy ‘ a lighthouse' in general, in which sense it is preserved in
the French phare. The event alluded to is the capture of Alexandria
by Octavianus in Β. c. 30, which was the immediate consequence of the
battle of Actium. From this final victory dates the true commence-
ment of the reign of Octavianus as the undisputed ruler oi the Roman
empire. Horace celebrates the event-or rather the death oi Cleo·
patra which immediately succeeded it-in an ode oi triumphant
exultation‚ 1. 37, and fisteen years afterwards he emphatically dates
the Empire oi Augustus from that day: Od. 4 14. 34

nam tibi, qua die
