TO TJaULLUS. xxiii

between the composition of elegies 10 andr. The style
certainly bears no trace of any such interval. We can ,
hardly help suspecting that, with his strong dislike to
arms, Tibullus may have found in the confusions of the
time some means of evading or abridging his term of
military service. It is hard also to understand how he
could have spent ten of the best years of his lise in active
campaigning without leaving a single indication of the
fact in his poems: more especially as he has left us an
ample record of his subsequent achievements in the train
of his patron Messalla.

Of that distinguished man—M. Valerius Messalla
Corvinus-a short account is given in the note to Tib. 1. 1.

he had originally been a warrn supportet of the Republican

about the year 37 or 36 Β. e. At what period his fn'endship
for Tibullus began, we know not: but he was doubtless

he became his firm friend and patron through life. In
the commencernent of the year Β. c. 31 (see 1. 1.) we find

the autumn of the same year, Messalla was despatched by
Octavianus to put down a rebellion amongst the Gauls of
Aquitania: Tibullus accompanied him throughout the
campaign, and in the seventh Elegy of the First Book
has left a vivid account of the tribes and the places
which he saw during its progress. Towards the end of
Β. e. 30, Messalla was invested by Augustus with a general
commission to establish the affairs of the East (see Introd.
to 1. 3): Tibullus again accompanied him, but falling
sick at Corcyra, was left behind, and was unable to '
Ι rejoin his patron. lt was during his illness on this
occasion that he composed the despondent but beautiful
poem 1. 3. From this time onvards the poet led a life
