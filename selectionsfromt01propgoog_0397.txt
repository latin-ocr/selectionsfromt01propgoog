330 NOTES.

they chose names of the same number of syllables, and of the same
metrical quantity, as the originals. Thus Catullus writes of Clodii as
Lesbis, Horace of Terentia as Licymnia The poem besore us is full
of fine feeling and of delicate natural touches, which separate it toto
caelo from the laboured sweetness and saultless artificiality of Ovid's
Heroides. Hertz. puts the date of the composition at Bc. 20. As to
whether Ovid copied Propertius in this style of poetry see note on l. 3.

st potes. The indicative implies that the sentence is hypo-
thetical in form only. There is no doubt about the potes: what
she expresses is astonishment at the fact.

3. tamen is not easy to explain. It may referto the supposed
completeness of the mandata: ‘This is my message: yet if it seem
wanting in any part, know that it is my tears that are the cause!
But it is better to reser it to the doubt os his lore implied in 1, a.
‘ Thou hast‘ scarce the right to call thyself mine: and yet these lines
are all blotted with my tears.‘ Cp. Ov. Her. 3. 3

These passages are remarkable: it is scarcely possible to avoid the
conclusion that either Ovid copied Propertius, or Propertius Ovid.
Note the correspondence between Si qua tamem and Si qua tamem
tibi lecturo and quascunque adspicies ,· oblita and oblitus ; litura and
lituras; ι lacrimis meis and lacrimae fecere. Further, in the next
lines of Ovid's epistle Canace speaks of her approaching death:

Dextra tenet calamum ; strictum tenet altera finam,
while Prdp. l. 6 has dextrae iam monentis, words out of keep-
ing with the res} of the poem, in which the young lady makes uo
reference to death or suicide. From Ov. A. A. 3. 34⁶ it would seem
that Ovid could not have been the imitator, as he claims originality
in this kind of poetry:

[geroium hoc aliis ille mavit opus.
As Ovid was born in 13.c. 43, aud as the Heroides were probably the
earliest ol his works‚ it is quite possible that Propertius may have
been acquainted with them when he wrote this poem.
