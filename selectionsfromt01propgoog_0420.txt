PROPERTJUS,1v. 6.‚ 36-62. 3 53

u'nontz's as an accusative after vehunt, agreeing with some substantive
nderstood (‘ forms threatening with (t) Centaurs' rocks,’ Postgate,
r ‘ figures threatening to hurl giant stones,' Pinder)‚ is very awkward.
tuh Centauros all is plain: ‘and as to their prows carrying Cen-
turs which hurl stones' The expression is confused, referring both
› the Centaure, which were often put as fignreheads, and to the
uge catapults for hurling stones, with which Dion. 50. 33 tells us
ntony’s ships were fitted. Propertius may have thought the two
ere combined. ¹

50. algua, referring to the timber frames put round some of
re vessels, either to protect them from being rammed‚ or to assist in
harding the enemy. These timbers would be found to offer no
>sistance (cavo), and the engines to be mere painted bogeys.

tempori· auctor, because Apollo has suggested the moment

ritten to order.

57. fide, for ‘ Phoebus was true to his word and true to the
ause which he protected.' Postgate.

58. sceptra tracta vehuntur, a powerfnl metaphor: the

utro, the comet or meteor into which Caesar’s soul was popu-
rrly believed to have passed, Suet. Jul. 88.

60. A very dull and egotistieal remark to escape from the
eified Julius on such an occasion. His style had not improved.

ista fides, i. e. ‘this exploit of yours (ista) proves you to be of
