the nuth), may I continue to feed on the sacred lanrel unharmed‚
and preserve my maiden purity' In other words, she is williug to

· risk her future position as priestess on the truth of her statements.

Precisely similar is our own form of oath, ‘So help me God;’ before
which comes the promise, ‘I speak‚ or will spealr, the truth' In
other words, ‘ Ι· am willing to rest all my hopes of help from God
upon the truth of my statements.’ Sometimes, instead of a de-
claratory indicative, as here vera coreo, we have ut before the in·
dicative, as ut vero cauo. The meaning would still be th'e same:
‘aa 1te11,’ ‘ as surely as I tell,' ‘in proportiou as Ι tell, the truth, so,
on that condition, may such and such a thing happen to me.’ Au
excellent instance of this is Catuli. 45. 13-16
Sic, iuquit, mea vito, Septimille,
Huic uni domim usque serviamus, .
U t multo mihi maior acriorque
Ignis mollibus ardet iu medullis, ,

Love as it is true thot a fiercer flame burna in my heart than in

- In case (b), where a prayer ia preferred, the main clause has an
imperative instead of an indicative, with or without ut: thus Virg.
E. 1o.1 sqq.
Extremum huuc, Arethusa, milri concede laborem:
Sic tibi, quum stuctm praeterlabere Sicanos,
Dor-is amoro seram uon intermisceat undam,
i. e. ‘Is thou greatest my prayer, Iwill pray in tum for thee that,'
etc. Exactly similar are Virg. E. 9. 30 sqq. ; Ov. Her. 4, 168 ; ib. 3.
1353 Hor. Od. 1. 3. r, 73 ib. 1. 28. 23,27, and below l. rar. In all
cases alike sic goes with an optative verb. We may thus typify in
a simple form the three possible constructions:
(1) Vera dico: sic felix sim,-
(a) Ut aera dico, sic felix siin ;
i. e. ‘may my future happiness depeud upon the trnth of what 1
say?
(3) Dic milei vera: sic felix sis;
i. e. ‘Tell me the truth, and may your future happiness depeud
upon your telliug it)
