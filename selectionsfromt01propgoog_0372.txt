anapaestus 111.11.,3-18. , 305

Non ego constiteram sumpta peltata securi,
Qualis in iliaca Penthesilea sela.
15. When Achilles liited the helmet from her iace, he was en>
amonred oi her beanty.
cassida, archaic for the more usual form cassis. So Virg. Aen.
11. 775. The helmet ‘bared' her face by being taken off. An
elliptical or ‘condensed' (Pinder) expression, similar to placidi
straverunt aequora venti Virg. Aen. 5. 763 and similar phrases.
Cp. 3. aa. 22 and note.
16. viere victorem recalls Hor. Epp. a. 1. 156
Graecia capta J‘ernm victorem cepit.
eandida, ior ‘beantifnh’ seems strange as an epithet offorma ;
but see note on a. 3. ²4· The word is frequently applied to a person
as awhole, or to some part of the body, as brachia 2. 16. 24, colla
3. 17. 29, pes, humeri, cervix, etc, and Ov. Met. 1. 743 alfords an
exact parallel to the phrase besore us,
De bove nil superest, formae nisi canedor, in illa. .
17. All the MSS. read empnam which involves a hiatus, anda
shortening of the last syllable. Virgil and other poets have this
linense not unfrequently‚ as E. 8. 108, in the first thesis of a dactyl,
Credimus? an qni amant ipsi sihi samniafingunt?
But, as Palmer points out, it is very rare in the last syllable of a

dactyl (see Virg. E. 3. 79 aelle* vill inquit, and Aen. 3. 211 Insnlle ·

levio), and it is unknown to Propertius ; so he most ingeniouslycon-
jectnres Iardanis, ‘daughter oi Jardanus,'a name by which Omphale
is designated by Ovid, Her. 9. 103. He points out that in no less than
ten instances Propertius designates female characters by their patro-
nymics3 thus Helen is called Tyndaris, Penelope lenientis, Niobe

’ Tantalis, and so on. Omphale would thus be a natural gloss, im-

ported in'to the text. Further he points out that the scribe who

0 copied Omphale into N. had a rage for lengthening syllables in

proper names, and probably intended Omphale to be scanned Om-
pha'le. Tne same hand has elsewhere Antilochi for Anttltehe' 2. 13.
49, Arethusa ior helthusa 4. 3. 1, whileother MSS. have Capanei
ior Clphnn a. 34. 40. One MS. inserts et aster Omphale, but the
word is out of place, an evident interpolation.

mium goes with ut l. 19. ’

in natum formae processit honorem, a very strained ex·
pressiori: ‘reached such a pitch oi beauty.’ Hanar, as in its tech·
nical politieal sense oi ‘a public office‚’ is here used to denote ‘an
external mark, stage, or degree' oi beauty. ’
