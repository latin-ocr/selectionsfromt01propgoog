monuerim, 111. 1., 1-6. 259

- 3. ingredior has immediate reference to ire l. 2: in l. 4 he
changes the idea, end uses the word in the metaphorical sense of
‘beginning' or ‘undertaking‘ Thus instances of the infinitive after
ire, pergere, etc, are not quite in point.

puro de fonte, partly from the idea of priests sprinkling
themselves and the worshippers with pure water: partly from that
of drinking in inspiration from springs sacred to the Muses. Cp. 3.
3. 51 quoted above.

Ι4. orcle, ‘secret' rites,’ like μυστήρια, especially of the rites of
Bacchus. Thus the idea is that the sacred rites and emblems of
Italian worship are to be carried on and worshipped under the forms
of Greek choric dance and song. In other words, the boast is the
same as that more simply expressed by Hor. Od. 3. 30. 13 under a
different metaphor,

Dicar
Pra'nceps Aeolium carmen ad Italos
Deduxisse modos.

To take per withltalaorgr'a, even if admissible, would be to remove
aslight harshness of meaning hya greater harshness of language.

5. pariter, ‘side by side;' implying not only that the two
poets are equal‚ but equal in the same style of poetry.

tenuastis, referring to the fineness and finish of their verses.
The idea is taken from spinning, to which the drawing out of verses
(like our ‘ spinning a yarn ’) is so often compared. Cp. Hor. Ep. 2.
1. 22 5, imitated by Columella 10. 40

Pierides tenui deducite carmine Musae.

so vug' E· ⁶⁸ ⁵ deductum dicere carmen.

antro. Caves and grottoes were specially regarded as haunts
of the Muses: artificial grottoes were ¹frequently manufactured

in the grounds of Roman villas, and called musea. In 3. 2. 14 such , ¹

grottoes are called operm antra: see too 3. 3. 27.

6. quove pede has no reference to the superstition that it was
more lucky to enter a place with the right foot (cp. Juv. Sat. 10. 5

Quid tarn dextro pede canapis?

where see Mayor), for (1) utro would be required with that sense;
(2) it would be absurd to prouounce these poets unrikalled, and in
the same breath to ask whether they had begun their career auspi·
ciously or n0t; (3) the sense of the whole passage requires a
question as to the cause and secret of their success. Postgate is
doubtless right in supposing that pede conveys a double meaning:
(1) the natural one of ‘gait,’ and so ‘march’ ‘progress‚’ ‘success ;’
