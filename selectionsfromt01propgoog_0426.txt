cases was decided. But there is no eallto decide this point: ‘the
urn‚’ whatever its nse, was a recognised accompaniment and emblem
oi judicial proceedings, and the poeta, in using the phrase, did not
concern themselves to consider to what special use it was to be put.
The placing of the nrn on the table-the drawing of the lot—are
signs that there isto be a regularly-constituted trial, followedby a
verdict audasentence. Thisisallthat Virgil means, Aen. 6. 430-432,
by nec„ . .sine sorte, sine iudice and quaesitor Minas uremm nrovet.
The commentators refine overmuch: see Conington and Hor. Od. 3.
1.16,etc. ,

20. nndtoat tn, ‘prononnce sentence,’ or ⁸ inflict punishment
upon,’ in accordance, as Postgate observes, with the original mean·
ing of the word aim dicere. Thus impersonally, Caes. B. G. 3. 16
in quos εο gravius Caesar vindicandum statuit.

sortita, either transitively ‘by a ball which assigns me my
destiny,‘ as in Hor. Od. 3. 1. 15

aequa lege Necessitas
Sortitur insignes et imas ,¹
or passively, as in 5. 7. 55 and Stat. Silv. 5. a. 57
Mille urb'es Asiae sortita rexerit anno. ,

21. arnume introduces the idea of assessore, often appointed
to assist a iudex in the conduct ol a case. The assessors are Minos
and Rhadamanthus, sons of Zeus, and therefore brothers oi Aeacus.

Uinnius. sellam, a certain correction for Minoia sella ol the
MSS. Minois is used ior Ariadne a. 24. ογ. The obJ'ection to
Palmer's conjecture, Arsideum, fratrem iuxta Minoia sella et, is that
the Eumenides could not be spoken olas assessors .· they are avengers,
waiting in court to executa the sentence so soon as pronounced.
Assideant is applied non-technically to the Furias, by a kind of
zeugma. Plessis reads iuxta Minoa: sed astet.

22. intento . . . foro expresses the silence and strained atten-
tion ol the court.

23. mole, ‘thy burdeusome rask!

24. ausano should probably be read, froma form Tantaleus,
corresponding to a possible Greek form Ταντάλεως. Fallax Tantaleus
liquor is weak: Palmer adopts com'pere ονε, supporting it by a. 17. 6

Ut liquor arenti fallat abore silius
But ab ονε there is emphatic and ess'ential to the point of the line.

25. petat, ‘make for,' ‘attack’

improbus. Postgate sayss ‘ “Unconscionable” about hits the
genem meaning of the word! Is this note an explanation? Is
it notan dalimnanus a translation once given of improbus anser,
