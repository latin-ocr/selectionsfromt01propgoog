PROPERTIUS, 11. 1., 27-33. 219

Clodius, ue. 58 ; Antony presented it to the children oi Cleopatra3
aud after the battle ol Actium it becanm an imperatorial province. Its
sate therefore might well be mentioned separately from that of Egypt.
oum tractum N. has curn attractus, others contractus or con·
tactus, from which Palmer and Baehrens have both independently
conjectured atratus. With that reading the idea would be that the
Nile was in mouming when representatione of himself and his seven
mouths were borne along in the triumph os Octavianus. Prop.
3. 5. 34 affords an excellent illustration‚ both as to sense and reading.
The Sun's horses in eclipse are represented as being in monming:
Solis et atratis luxerit orbis equis ,·
and there, as here, atratis has been changed, in Gron. to attractis,
in Per. to actractt's. With atratus, nrbe should be read. That
pictures os rivers were carried along in triumphs is well known:
thus Pers. 6. 47
ingentesque locat Caesonia Rhenes.

§o Ovid, Art. 1. 223, where the Tigris and Euphrates are pointed out ’
as part oi atriumphal show. More to the point is Virg. Aen. 8. 711,
where the Nile himself is represented on the shield os Aeneas as
grieving at the defeat of Cleopatra, and in immediate connection
with Caesar's triple triumph :

Contra autern magno maerentem corpore nstlnn,

Pandentemqne sinna, et tota ueste vocantem

Caemlenm in gremium latebrosaque flumina victos.

If we read tractus in urbem the idea will be that of dre Nile
brought in triumph from Egypt to Rome, which is merged l. 3²
in the more natural idea of the great seven-mouthed river flowing
weak through sorrow.

32. Mark the stately bnt subdued cadence of this line, so fitting
to the sense. The very division into seven seems to proclaim the loss
of power and glory to the river, as though a victim to the maxim
Divide et impera. The idea os ‘the Nile enchained and dragged to
Rome as a captive wien itrseven manths' scarcely deserves the epithet
'happy’ given to it by Paley.

33. As a Roman could never be supposed to conquer, or obtain
a triumph over, Romans, the triumph was ostensibly held over the
native princes who had beiriended Antony, such as Philadelphus,
king oi Paphlagonia, Amyntas os Pisidia, Deiotarus ol Galatia. ln
the same way Caesar in Β. c. 46 did not triumph over Pompey, Scipio,
or Cato, but over Pharnaces and Juba.

These lines are an exact counterpart to Hor. Od. 4.· 3. 6, where it
is said of the poet ’
