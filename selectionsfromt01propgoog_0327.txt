or union of ideas from Ov. Am. 3.1.8

The ancients were constantly led into salse reasonings from not
distinguishing between the literal and metaphorical uses os words.
quamve bibistis aquam? continues the same sense, ‘From
what spring did you gain your inspirationi’ The allusion, asin a. ro.

To say' (with Postgate) that tenui, ‘fine' stands for ‘refining’ is
unnecessary; nothing is commoner, both in ancient and modern
poetry, than to court variety by using an adjeaive with some noun
to which it does not strictly apply, leaving the mind insensibly to
alter the relation between the words. When Hor. Ep. 1. 19. 18 says
exsangue cuminum, we translate ‘the bloodless cumin,’ and need
no commentator to tell us that it is the cheek, not the plant, to
which the epithet applies. So with pallidam Pirama Pers. Prol.

the poetry. Cp. divitis Nili Juv. 13. ²7· In the present passage,
tenui could not mean ‘refining’ because pumice-stone makes things ’
smooth, not fine; and it is clear that the epithet derives its point
from vertras, not from pumice. Pumice-stone no doubt was used to
smoothe the edges oi a parchment-roll when finished and rolled up ;

but there is no allusion here to a finished boolr, only to the smooth
