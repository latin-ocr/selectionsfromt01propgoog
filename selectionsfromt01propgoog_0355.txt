288 Nom. '

1. 3230, used thus abraptly, implies surprise, almost remon·
stauce, at a conclusion forced suddenly upon the speaker, and from
which he feels there is uo escape. Thus Hor. Od.'1. 24· 5

ι Erga Quintilium perpetuus sapor
Urget!
Ovid. Trist. 3. a. 1
Ergo erat iu fatis Scythiam quaque visere nastris! ‘
In Hor. Sat. 2. 5. 101 lt is an exclamation which bursts from the
disappointed legacyhunter on the reading oi the will:
erga nunc Dama sadalir
Nusquam est?

1’eaun1ais here personitied and treated as a Deity. The
Romans worshipped, and erected temples to, a whole multitude of
abstract qualities, such as Fides, Concordia, Honos, Victoria, Juven-
tas. Fama, etc. Juvenal sarcastieally observes that, as yet, Money is
not so worshipped :

· etsi, funesta Pecunia, templa
Nondum habitas, nullas Nummorum ereximus aras,
Ut colitur Pax atque Id‘des, Victoria, Virtus,
Quaeque salutata crepitat Coruardia uida.
Most MSS. insert es aster vitae, N. omits it.

2. The late H. A. J. Munro severely handled a translator of
Gray's elegy sor rendering ‘the paths of glory' by haurris iter, de-
claring that the line

Ad tumuli fauces ducit honoris iter

could have no meaning except ‘ The path of a public office leads to
the gorge of a hillock.’ We have seen above on 3. 1. 22 that Honor
may be used in an abstract sense, like our Honour or Glory; the
phrase mortis iter here is a warrant lothariuis iter. Immatumra
would certainly be condemned by an ordinary correctores verses:
the epithet properly belongs to martis, not to iter. And it is almost
hypercritical to say (with Postgate) that adimus is not appropriate to
iter. Adire martem or pen'culum mertis is as good Latin as adire
aa' mortem: ‘to enter upon the path of death’ s a perfectly natural
expression, and martis iter is analogous to Phasidos viam 1. 20. 18
and caeli iter 2. 1. ao.

3. This line isvery modern in its tone, especially in applying
an epithet like crudelia to pabula. Paley explains the word by ὠμά,
i. e. ‘causing so much bloodshed.' But the idea of bloodshed is
foreign to the poem: note curarum in the next line.

4. eapite is used with reference to the personality of Recunia.
Caput by itsels, no doubt, and in a proper connection, may mean the
