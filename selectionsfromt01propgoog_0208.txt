TIBULLUS, l. 7., 27-28. 141

becomes inextricable, from the practice of employing the Greek deuo-
minations at once, without noticing the native names. Thus Greek
writers, when discussing Egyptian mythology, speak of the rites ol
Apollo, Pan, Artemis, Hermes, Hephaestus, Latoua¹ and othere,
just as familiarly as if they were describing the ceremonies of Atheus
or Argos3 while, in many instaures, we have uo means ol ascertain-
ing, beyond some vague and fortuitous resemblance, the nature of
the personages to whom they refer.

‘There seems, however, to be no doubt that Osiris, and his consort
Isis, were two principal objects of popular adoratiou among the
Egyptians, and that their worship was not confined to any particular
· district, as was the case with many oi their deificabat prevailed over
the whole land. As to the nature of this pair, we lind, as might be
expected from the remarks made above, various and conflicting
accounts. By some, Osiris was considered to be the Suu (Plutarch.
Isid. et Osirid.; Diog. Laert. in prooemi0; Macrob. Sat. 1. 21); by
others, to be a personification of the river Nile (Eusebius-Selden, de
Dis Syriis 1. 4, see Prichard's Egyptian Mythology, p. 76) ; but,
according to the idea generally entertained hythe Greeks, hewas
the same with their Dionysus or Bacchus, the Liber Pater of the
Latius, and as such he is represented by Tibullus in the lines be·

‘Isis again was by many regarded as the Moou (Plutarch de Isid.
et Osirid.; Diodor. 1. 11); by others, as Pallas Athene (Plutarch as
before); but generally by the Greeks as the same with their Demeter,
or Mother Earth, the Ceres of the Latius. This is expressly asserted
by Herodotus, a. 156, and corroborated by Diodorus, 1. 13. She is,
however, often consounded with Argive Io, e. g. Ov. Met. 1. 588,

bull, Apis, which was kept at Memphis, the capital of Lower Egypt,
in a magnificent temple, to which were attached spacions pleasure
grounds, where he might take healthsul exercise (Aeliau. de Animal.

(Strabo 173 Diodor. 1), and was recognised by a number of peculiar
marks described by Pliny, H. N. 8. 46, and Aelian, De Animal. a.
