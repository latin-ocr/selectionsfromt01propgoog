lviii INTRODUCTION

mann in the notes of this edition are to the read-

ings of the edition of 1816. In 1835 appeared the very
useful Frencb edition published by Lemaire; and from
1843 to 1845 appeared the great edition of Hertzberg‚

both critical and explanatory. Itis the great standard x

edition, full of matter of every description, but unequal
and ill-arranged, and, like so many learned German works,

1 frequently deficient in taste and judgment. Of Baehrens’

work we have already spoken. His critical apparatus is
the most complete that has yet been published; but his
text is injured by his predisposition to depreciate N.‚ and
disfigured by many wild and tasteless conjectures. Many
of these, doubtless, will be abandoned in his next edition,
and it may be thought that too many of them have been
noticed in this edition. But his authority is great, his
edition is quoted as a standard edition, and it is well
to show in particular instances what are the taste and
judgment of the critic who makes such large demands
upon our confidence. The edition of L. Mueller in the
Teubner series is less adventuresome, and follows mainly
in the lines of Lachmann. ln England we have the very
full and serviceable commentary of Paley, published
in 1853 and 1872; and in 1880 Professor Palmer pub-
lished bis admirable critical edition of the text, which
has brought out in a striking way the true value of N.
by exhibiting in italics every word, even every letter, in
which the reading adopted departs from that MS. The
notes are in the best spirit of modern critical scholarship:
their only fault is that they are too few. Different alto·
gether in scope and aim is the delightful selection of
Professor Postgate (1881), which includes about one-fourth
of the works of our poet, selected on a principle different
from that followed in this edition. The explanatory notes
are of first-rate quality; but the chief value and originality
Ι of the book lies in the Introduction, which contains the
most complete and thoughtful study that has yet appeared
