’ 174 noras,

inventum esse dicitur, tenens in manu librum. Cuius sacra (some
MSS. sortes) senatus in Capitolium transtulerit. From this, Sca-
liger, with much plausibility conjectured Albana, instead of Albana,
although Aniena (ie. Anierea) Tiburs, which appears iu some
Italian MSS„ is, perhaps to be preferred!

71-78. This passage describes the portents which took place
before Caesar’s assassination, and bears a marked likeness to the
similar passages Hor. od, 1. a.1-2o, and Virg. Geo. 1. 466-492.
In ll. 466-8 the darkening os the sun after the eclipse of n. c. 44 is
referred to:

Ille ettam exstineto miseratus Caesare Romam,
Quum caput obscura nite'dum ferragine texit,
Impiaque aeternam timuerunt saecula noctem.

This phenomenon is specially mentioned by Pliu. H. Ν. o. 30, and
Plutarch.

72. depresses, the proper tense aster dixeruntfare ut. Note
this extreme case os the misplacement ol que. It comes after the
fifth word in the sentence.

74. Audita, i. e. audita esse.

lacon cp. Virg. Geo. 1. 476

Vax quoque per lacos vulgae exaudita silentes
Ingens.

75. defectum lumine, for the more usual deficientem ; lic

‘worn out,’ ‘enfeebled in its light‚’ as Ov. Fast. 3. ⁶74

76. pallentes . . . equos. Plut. says os the sun throughout
that year ὠχρὸς μὲν ὁ κύκλος καὶ μαρμαρυγὰς οὐκ ἔχων. Prop. 3.
5. 34 solis atratis equis is not in point, as that passage points to 1
mourning, this to the sun’s having lost his wouted fires.

79. ruerus. The tense puts all this catalogue of ill portent
far back into the past and gone.

Horace in like manner, Od. 1. 2. 29, turns first to Apollo to
cleanse the people from the guilt ol which the portenta were a sign.

80. indomitis. implying that the waters have power to wash
off every pollution, however great Monstrous births, etc„ were
thrown into the sea.

81. At sacrifices, and especially in magical incantations, laurel
leaves were thrown into the fire, and omens were drawn from their
modes os crackling. Prop. a. 28. 35

defia'um magico sub carmine rhombi,
Et tacet extincto laumas adusta saco.
