64 ‘Catullus 64. 312 gives us a most virid description of the
primitive methodos spinning, with the· distaff (colus) and spindle
(funos) which was common in this country until within a few years,
and is still universally employed by the peasantry of southern Italy
and of Greece :¹

Laeua calum molli lana retimbat amictum; ·
Dextera tum leuiter deducens fila supinis
Fornoabat degitis ; tuen prono in pollice torquens
Libonotum tereti versabat turbine fusum:

Here the left hand holds the distaff with the mass of wool at the
top; the fingers of the right, palm uppermost. draw down and

watches that it shall corne ont evenly‚ biting off any lump or ir·

are baskets full of the cleaned and carded fleeces wherewith to re· .

be seen sculptured on the fragment of the Temple called ‘Pallas
Minerva’ in the forum of Augustus at Rome, now forming the front

the framework of the loom, rattles as it moves from side to side
when the threads of the woof (subtemen) are driven honre by¹ the lay
