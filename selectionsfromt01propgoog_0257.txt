190 , NOTES. ,

patratu is peculiar, as instead of being used prolately with an
infinitive, it has an accus'ative with the infinitive after it. This con÷
struction is not uncommon with verbs ol wishing, etc, in Plautus.

16. tutertamanu. Clearlyused of the threatening or upbraid·
ing hand. Postgate's suggestion that the words may mean ‘with
hand hostile to myself‘ of beating the breast, etc, though possible,
does not seem in harmony with the passage, and destroys the con-
trast of crudelem infesta

vocare manu may be either, as Postgate suggests, a compression
of two things or two stages, ‘speaking by hand and voice,' into one,
aster the manner of Propertius (see his Introduction), orit may
be a somewhat harsh zeugma (is it may be so called), implying that
his hand was now his only instrument of speech.

The maledictions are scarce uttered‚ when the poet repents of
having uttered them: he recants, and prays that after all she may
have a prosperous voyage.

17. quoeunque modo, equivalent to utcunque: the phrase
would be more naturally connected with a transitive verb.

18. Gnatae, a sea-nymph, taken as representative ol the
powers of the deep. In Aen. 9. 102 Jupiter promises Cybele that
snch of Aeneas' ships as reach Italy in salety shall be changed into
sea-goddesses,

qualis Nereia Doto

Et Galatea secant spumantem pectore pontum.
It is possibly from a recollection of this passage that Horace
gives the name of Galatea to a maiden whom he would dissuade
srom crossing the ater sinus Hadriae in time of stonn, Od.

3‘ 2γιιοιι altena viae, imitated by Ovid, Am. a.11.·34. altana,

‘hostile‚' ‘nntriendly,’ as frequently in Cic„ with or without animus
or animo: Tac. Hist. 2. 74 Muciani animus mc Vespasiano
alienus..

19. praevecta, as the reading stands in the MSS. (ut te . . . ¹

praevecta) must be the vocative sor the accusative, just as it stands
for the nom. iu the well-known passages in Pers. 1. 123 and 3. ²9

Stemmata quod Tusco ramum milesime ducis.
In both passages the use of the Vocative is harsher than it is here,
as it stands as the predicate of the sentence. Postgate is inclined to
adopt utere with Baehrens, pointing out that the imperative is osten
used in inscriptions, in short prayers‚ and that the omission of tc,
involved by that reading, is quite Propertian (see Introduction).
Harsh as is the transition thus involved from the 3rd person insit
