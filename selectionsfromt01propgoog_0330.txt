23, 24. The idea is similar to, but not quite the same as, that
of Hor. Od. 3. 24. 31, 32

Virtutem incolumen odimus
, Sublatam ex oculis quaerimus invidi:

the contrast here is merely as to the extent of a man’s fame.
22. Ξοιιοι. This passage, with its imitation by Ov. Am. 1.15.'4o,

- is enough to disprove the dictum that Honor, especially in the singu-

lar, means necessarily some concrete thing and especially ‘a public
office? It is here personified as a quality and is equivalent to

⁴ gloria. See note on Tib. 1. 7. 53.

23. omnia. . ungit maiora, ‘fashions everything on a larger
scale? Fingere refers essentially to the plastic arts and processeS, and
is applied to the moulding of any ductile substance. It does not
therefore mean here simply ‘ makes greater,’ ‘magnifies’ (Postgate),but
it refers to making up, as it were, and fashioning the materials of the
past on a new aud larger scale. Fingeut rutilam Hor. Od. 4. 3. 12
is ‘will shape into nobility.'

vetustas is the abstract quality implied by vetus, which properly ¹
means ‘ old’ in the sense of ⁸ having lasted fora long time! Thus
it is applied by Horace to old trees, oid wine, old friends, old stories,
old poems. Vetustas therefore is simply ‘length of time,' ‘age‚'
which is here said, in its simplest meaning, to magnify the past.
Thus Postgate’s explanation is unnecessarily elaborate: ‘ a prospec-
rive-retrospective use, an age to come when the present shall be a
distant past.’ Pinder is right in tmnsiating ‘ The oldness of things
makes them seem greater.’ Cp. uetustate dilapsum in the Inscrip-
tion quoted on 3. 2. 12.

24. ab, ‘after’ The phrase is imitated, as Postgate points out.
by Ov. P. 4. 16. 3.

25. Ram, proceeding to give instances.

pulsas is not very appropriate to uass, but this kind of con-
fusion is precisely in the manner of Propertius. The explanation of
Paley and Postgate, that when he said equo pulsas he had a battering-
ram in mind, seems harsh and unpoetical. For the following pas·
sage cp. Joanna Baillie:
