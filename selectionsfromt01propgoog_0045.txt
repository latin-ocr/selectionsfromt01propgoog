- ‘Faithsul thou wert, ah me! though not sprung from
Ι noble ancestors, nor over rich withal.'
So again, 2. 34. 5 5
Aspice me, cui parva domi fortuna relicta est,
Nullus et antiquo Marte triumphus avi.

‘See me, to whom but modest home and fortune have
been lest, and who have no ancestors that gained triumphs.
in ancient war!

At an early age he lost his father, 4. 1. 127-130

Ossaque legisti non illa aetate legenda
Patris, etin tenues cogeris ipsc Lares:
Nam tua cum multi versarent mra intumi,
Abstulit excultas perlt'ca tn'stis optes.
⁰ ‘Thou didst gather thy father’s bones at an age that was
not meet, and wast thyself reduced to a slender horne:
fult many a steer was wont to plough thy lands‚ but the
accursed measuring-rod (he. of confiscation) took that
well-tilled wealth away!

The latter lines inform us that soon alter his father’s
death his property was included, either in whole or in
part—as the words cui parva domi fortuna relicta est
seem to imply—among those confiscated by the triumvirs
in Β. ε, 41. Mr. Postgate has pointed out that the horror
with which the poet speaks os the siege of Perusia in nc. 41
—in the course of which he lost one of his relatives-is
to be explained by the fact that that event was associated
with the lowest period os the family lomnes, and that
Propertius himself, as a timid sensitive boy, may have
witnessed some of the terrible scenes that attended it.
His father dead, his property confiscated, he was brought
up under the supervision ol his mother, who in all proba·
bility took him to Rome for his education‚ and expended
upon him the same loving care that H'orace informs us
he experienced at the hands of his father. He received,
at any rate, the best education which Rome could afforcl,
and in due time, his mother being still alive, he assumed
the toga virilis.
