uuum, i. e. ‘in your own miud and beart!

Ι 18. inpransum, with 'sense of motion: ‘rising to cheer,’ Post-
gate.

iuvent, ‘be thy delight,‘ as in Hor. Od. 1. 1. 4.

19. Attalicas. See note on 2. 13. 22.

mpero, ‘ outvie,' ‘outd0.’

20. Gemma, in allusion to the costly and extravagant novel·
ties of decoration in which the exhibitors of games vied with one
another in their efforts to obtain popularity. We hear of the scene
of a theatre being overlaid with silver, ivory, or gold ς of the arena
being strewn with vermili0n; of the cord of the podium being twined
with gold, or covered with amber ornaments, etc.

reta, contemptuous. There is no authority or excuse for read·

21„ This line is very unsatisfactory as it stands in the MSS.‚
Sed tama hoo. Tamen seems clearly to be wrong: it is wealr in

itself, and gives a quite unnecessary emphasis to sed. Hoc appears ’

in all the MSS. before omnes: if the more easy hus was written by
Propertius, it is inexplicable how the more difficult reading hoc came
to be substituted for it. On this ground Professor Palmer suggests
to me that tomen was introduced iu consequence of Sed, and that
the true reading is Sed manat hoc omnes. He quotes the Horatiah
Hoc quoque te manet Epp. 1. ao. 17, and points to the following
passage from the Epicedion Drusi, a poem modelled on Propertius,
as almost decisive:
Fato monent omnes ; omms expectat avarus
Portitor ; et turbae vix satis uno rotis.
Tendimus huc omnes: nutam properamus ad unam!
Omnia sub loges mors vocat atra sucas. ’
This passage seems t0 be a distinct echo of the passage before us.
Propertius probably wrote manet ,· and tamen, which contains exactly

the' same letters, got accidentally substituted for it. But Sedis ¹

Ι as much out of place astomen, for the poet has already declared that
all wealth, etc, will come to naught, in the emphatic words agonibus
isto dabis. What is needed in 1. 21 is not a contrast, but au ampli-
fication osthat themez ‘all will go to the flames: but nevertheless
all ends in death,' is a manifestly absurd connection. If we read
Hoc tamen, hocomnes all is clear. The repetition of Hoc. . . lzoc . . .
huc in one line was too much for the scribe: the corruption tomen
naturally suggested that of Hoc into Sed. The repetition Hoc. . .
hoc . . . huc is quite in the manner of Propertius. Cp. 4 4. 37
