- 304 NOTES.

3. crimina ignaui capitis, ‘a charge of cowardiee.’ Capitis
is used as above, 2. 1. 36, where see note. The neighbourhood of
addictum and crimen is intended doubtless to suggest also the
technieal meaning of the terms.

4. nequeam, the subjunctive, as constituting the crimen. The
figure in this line is changed to that of an animal under the yoke.

5. Venturam. . . mortem is the MS. reading. Hertz. adopts
noctem in the sense of ‘storm,’ quoting no authority. Palmer in his

, edition reads iactura, to correspond with vulracribn53 but he now

proposes Venturum . . . motam, and for motum, ‘a storm,' compares
Hor. Od. 3. 27. aa, and Prop. 3. 13. 21. See too Virg. Aen. 10. 99
Murmura venturos nantis prodentia ventos. The sour lines are an
expausion of the maxim experientia docet: ‘the sailor, the soldier,
learn by experience to expect danger: bold as were the words ol
my youth, I have a like experieirce to offer you’ The sentiment is
similar to that oi a. 27. 11.
R. Ellis, Journal of Phil. vol. 15. p. 19, ingeniously suggests

that Propertius had in view Pind. Nem. 7. 17

σοφοὶ δὲ μέλλοντα τριταῖον ἄνεμον

ἔμαθον, οὐδ’ ὑπὸ κέρδει βάλον,

σοφοί correspondingtonavita, ‘the trained seamanl But Ioannot “

believe in his suggested reading molem, which he illustrates byVirg.
Aen. 5. 789 quam molem subito excierit, of the storm got up at
Juno’srequest. ,

⁷. 1ata verba, i. e. ‘those words which you cast up against me
now.’
9. adamas (ἀδάμας), iron or steel: used figuratively for the
hardest conceivable substance, Ov. A. A. 1. 659 ¹

” lacrimis adamanta movebis.

The word is here used to heighten the sense of the passage, as though
‘to break bulls to a yoke of adamant ” implied a more complete sub·
jugation.

10. Cp. Ovid, Her. 12. 95

Arva venenatis pro semine dentibus imples:
Nascitur, et gladios scutaque miles labet.

humo, a local ablative. ·

11. anatome, in adjectival apposition to serpentis.

elausit hiatus, again like our colloquial ‘shut his mouth.’

12. Aeson was Jasou’s father.

14. rentheailea, queen of the Amazons, who dwelt round the
Lacus Maeotis (sea of Azov), came to help the Trojans during the
siege, and was slain by Achilles. Cp. Ov. Her. 21. 117
