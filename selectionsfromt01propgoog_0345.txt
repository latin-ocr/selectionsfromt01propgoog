NOTES.

Ill. 4.

Tffls poem is written in anticipation of the great expedition of
Augustus into the East, when he was to bring Parthia and India,
the Tigris and the Euphrates, under ¹the sway os the Latian Jupiter,
andwipe out the disgrace of Carrhae. Though the poet speaks of the
Indian Ocean (l. 3) and of the surthest East, it is to be noted that
he says nothing of Arabia: it might therefore be inserted that this
poem was written after the failure of the Arabian expedition, Β, c,

a mode of statement that would scarcely shock a modern ear.
Horace shows still more consummate art in the celebrated Second
Ode ol Book 1, in which he formally proclaims his political saith.
Reversing the order os Propertius, he descends from the divine to the
human; searchiug for one to whom Jupiter may assign the task os
wiping out from Rome the stain of smtricidal guilt, he passes in
review all the gods who care sor Rome: he descends gently from
Apollo the purifier to Venus and Mars, the mother and the father of
the Roman racc : then he passes on to Mercury‚ go-between between
men and gods, who as mutata iuvenem figura may consent to abide
on earth: then by carefully chosen human words—triumphas, pater,
princeps Medos—gradually paves the way for his identification,
but only in the very last word, with Caesar himself ε
Hic magnas patius triumphas,
