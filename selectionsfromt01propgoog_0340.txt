13. omasus. Immediately behind the town ol Delphi rises
MountPamassns, called δικόρυφον or δίλοφος (biceps Ov. Met. 1. 316,
a, 221, etc.) bythe ancients. This name was due not to the shape ol
the summit-invisible from Delphi itself—but to two sharp peaks,
separated by a deep clelt, which crown a tremendous precipioe which
overhangs the town. Down this precipice offenders against the
god were hurled3 aud srom its base issues the clear water of the
Castalium spring, dear to Apollo,

Qui rere pura Castaliae lavit
¹ Crines selectas

Hor. Od. 3. 4. 61.
Modern travellers have druuk the waters ol Castalia with varying
· result: Dr. Spen was seized with a fit ol poetic ecstasy ; Dr. Chand-
· ler with a shivering-fit aud a stomachache. Castalia was in Phocis:
but Propertius' dream was on Helicon iu Boe'otia. Postgate remarks
ou the sanciful topography ol the Roman poets, and quotes Statius
Silv. a. 7. 4, who speaksjof the Corinthiauas oue who Ι ·

Prudentis bibit ungulae liquorem,

in allusion to the louut Hippocrene. But this mistake, as we have

already seen, arose from the identificatiou of Hippocrene with Peirene

which was between Corinth aud the Lechaeum. See Pers. Prol. 4.
14 It is evident from what source the modern photographer has

Ι, derived his favour'ite background ol a tree-trunk or a grotto.

15. demens, used especially ol those who make vain pre-
teusions, as os Salmoneus, Virg. Aen. 6. 59⁰

Demens, qui nimbos et non imitabile fulmen ¹
Aere et cornipedum pulsu simularet equarum.

18. uolua. See note on 3. 1. 19.

19‚20. Le. your poetry should be os a light kind, to occupy
the leisure momeuts ol a maiden in her lover's absence. Scamnum is
‘a sootstool.'

21. N. has perscripta reuecta, others praescriptas. Sevecta occurs
nowhere else: Postgate renders it ‘deviate’ ‘swerve aside' Pros.
Palmer iu his edition has deuecta; but he tells me he has now with·
drawn that conjecture. The sense seems to require a question depre-
cating undue ambitiou, which devecta would not imply: aud the
change to praescriptos evecta is infinitesimal. For evebar with an
accusative cp. Tac. Anu. 12. 36 Unde fama eius euecta insulas et
proximas provincias peruagata per Italiam quaque celebrabatur.
Similarly egredi, exire, etc. take the accusative.
