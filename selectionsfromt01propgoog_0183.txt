NOTES.

Iam rapidus torrens sitientes Sirius Indos
, Ardebat,
and Virg. Aen. 3. 141
tum steriles exurere Sirius agros,
Arebant herbae, et vietum seges aegra negabat.
Our own familiar expression oi “The Dog-days'' is, oi course,
derived from the same source.⁸
28. Cp. Hor. who as a p'oet describes himself, Od. 1.1. 21, as
nune viridi membra sub arbuto
Stratus, nune ad aquae lene caput sacrae.

29. unusne, prob, simply ‘toherdf Cp. the similar phrase
‘to keep’ a baby. For tenere thus used emphatioally see n. on
Prop. a. ro. 14. . ,

Virg. applies the word to a stable, Geo. 3. 352, and to a hedge
Geo. 2. 371 in regard to cattle.

Tenuisse and increpuisse l. 30, beside referre l. 32, show that
little ›or no distinction can be drawn in such cases between the use
⁸ os the pres. and peri. infin. ’

30. The tumulus was a goad, i. e. a long stick with a sharp
spike at the eud oi it. Such an instrument is constantly in use in

- ⁸ South Italy at the present day.

34„ eet is placed by some Mss. at the end oi the line. But
· Dissen shows that the proper position ior est is aster magno as being
the emphatic word. Cp. above 1. 22 and 1. 5. 68

Ianua, sed plena est percutienda manu.

35. lto, on my farm. The allusion is to the Palilia, the feast
os Pales, god oi tlocks and shephetds, held on the alst of April.
'The day was supposed to mark the birthday os Rome: and is at
this day celebrated at Rome iu honour ol that event. For the
Palilia or Parilia cp. Ow. Fast. 4. 727. ¹Part ol the ceremony oi
purification consisted iu leaping 'over heaps ol buming straw. See
Tib. 2. 5. 87, · .

36. aarum lacte. It would seem that the statue of the god
was actually sprinkled with milk: Tib. 2. 5. 27

Lacte meteres illie suberat Pan ilicis umbrae,
Et sacta agresti lignea falce Pales.

38. fictilibus. Vessels oi common pottery were long used in
public sites, iu retention oi the simplicity os early times. In private
rites silver, and even gold. vessels came to be used: cp. Pers. a. 57

Aurum vasa Numae Saturniaque impulit aera,
while Juv. 11. 1161aments the good old days when Rome worshipped
Fictilis et nulio violatus Iuppiter auro.
