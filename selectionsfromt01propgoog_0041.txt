xxxiv INTRODUCTION

‘In the plain below, where the rich fertile landos
Umbria comes closest-there was I born ;’

i. e. he was born in the rich plain os Umbria, at the
point where it comes closest up to the walls of Perusia.
It is impossible that in these words Umbria as a whole
con be referred to: he clearly means to specify the par· ,
ticular part of Umbria with which he was connected.

²& In 4. 1. 61-66 he proclaims himself to 'be an U'm-
brian, and speaks in vague terms ol his genius being con-
nected with a city or ci'ties set upon a height above the
plain τ’

Ennius hirsuta cingat sna dieta corona:
Mi solia ex hedera porrige, Bacche, tna,

Ut nostn‘s tnnnfaeta superbiat Umbria libris,
Umbria Romani patria Callimachi.

Scandentes quisquis cernit de vallibus arces
ingenio muros aestimet ille meo.

‘ Let Ennius crown his sayings with rugged wreatb: but
hand thou to me, Bacchus, a chaplet of thine own ivy‚
that Umbria be litted up and boast her of my lays-Um-
bria the fatherland of the Callimachus of Rome. Who·
eversees yon heights climbing out of the valley,-—by my
genius let him rate those walls!

There is nothing in these words to show that Pro-
pertius had any particular town in view, or that he meant
to speak of such town as his birthplace.

3. More definite information is afforded by 4.1.121-
126

Umbria te notis antiqua Penatibus edit:
(Mentior? an patriae tangitur ora tnaet)

Qua nebulosa cavo rorat Mevania eampo,
Et lacus aestivis intepet Untber aquis,

Scandenntque areis camargit vertice murus,
Murus ab ingenio notior ille tuo.

‘Thy birthplace is ancient Umbria, in a home well·
