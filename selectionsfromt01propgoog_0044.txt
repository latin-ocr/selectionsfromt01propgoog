TO PROPERTIUS. xxxvii

· BLAESO.

Now Pliny the younger, Epist. 6. 15. 1, speaks of a Pas-
sennus Paullus as a learned eques and a poet, adding,
Gentilia'um leuc illi: est enim municeps Properti atque
etiam inter maiores suos Propertium narrat. There is
no evidence that Propertius left any child behind him;
the words ol Pliny do not necessarily mean more than that
Passennus counted Propertius as belonging to a previous
generation of his family; and even is they do mean more,
the claim of Passennus to be descended from Propertius
as an ancestor is no more prool of the lact than the
similar claim of the emperor Tacitus to be descended
from the historian. N evertheless, the statement ol Pliny,
taken along with the inscription, raises a strong proba-
bility that the Propertii were connected with Asisium, and
that Asisium was the nearest important town to the
property on which the poet was born .

The Propertii, it would appear, were a respectable
family in comfortable circumstances, but neither patrician,
noble, nor wealthy. Thus, in his childhood, Propertius
wore the golden bulla that was the sign of ingenuitas,

4. r. 131

Mox ubi bulla medi dimissa est aurea collo,
Matris et ante deos libere mnrpta toga ,-

‘Soon, when I laid aside the golden boss from my
neck, yet unfledged, and assumed the manly gown before
my mother’s gods,’

i. e. the Penates, so-called because his father was dead.
Agaln, 2. 24. 36, he represents Cynthia as addressing him
thus:

Certus eras, eheu! quamvis nec sanguine avito
Nobiles, ct quarnvz's non· ila dives eras.
