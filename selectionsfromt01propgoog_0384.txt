PROPERTIUS, ΙΙΙ. 18., 3-11. 317

vaguely to express every degree of evil or misfortnne, from the greatest
to the slightest‚ by which a person can be lowered or brought down.
Thus it may mean mere mental depreciation, as in Virg. Aen. 11.
40² contra premere arma Latini, or, as here, the most overwhelming
oi missortunes. cf. Ov. Ep. ex Pont. 1. 7. 11

. Nm premet aut bello tellus aut frigore caelum,

and Virg. Aen. 9. 330 Tres iuxta famulos . . . premit, where premit
means ‘slays‘

Baiae, in spite of its waters, was deemed an unhealthy place, as
appears from Cic. Epp. Div. 9. 12 Gratulor Baiis nostris, siquidem,
ut scribis, salubres repentae factae sunt, nisi forte . . .dum tu ades sunt
oblitae sui. Quod quidem si e'ta est, minime miror caelum etterras '
vim suam, si tibi conveniat, dimittere. Malaria to this day pervades
the district. 11· evidently refers to the various adverse circumstances
indicated; the mephitic vapours, the nnhealthiness of Baiae, the
presence of some hostile god in its waters. Palmer takes this passage
differently: ‘His (sc. undis) pressus in Stygias undas vultum demisit!

vultum hemaii in undas The common interpretation that
Marcellus was drowned in Avernus or the Bay oi Baiae, is uncalled
ior. Vultum demittere is a euphemistic term for dying, sng-
gested by the mention of Styx: ‘sank, or was lowered, to the Stygian

· waters' Such phrases as demittere Oreo Aen. 2. 398, Hor. Od. 1.

28. 11, d. neci id. 2. 85, etc, are quite common, and vultum gives
merely a more personal and poetical touch to the same idea The
idea os drowning may perhaps have been suggested by the beautiful
words in Lycidas, which exactly illustrate vultum demisit in undas,

It was that fatal arrd perfidiores bark

Built in tlte eclipse, oud rigged we'tlz eurses dark,

Tuae sunk so low that sacred head os thina!

10. spiritua iile. There is obviously here a double meaning:
the classical sense oi spiritua ‘inspiring breath‚’ and so ‘spirit' is
mingled with the idea suggested by the waters os Avernus, that the
¹soul oi Marcellus floats like a thin vapour on the water. Thus the
'passage giyes a kind oi anticipation oi the later use oi the word to
signify a ghost. Postgate well compares the idea oi ‘The Lake of
the Dismal Swamp.'

ll. optima The word optimus, on inscriptions and 'else-
where, of a father or mother or wife, etc, is a stock term oi praise,

' not denoting any special qualities, but merel'y a recognition that the

natural duties of the relationship have been well and duly‘discharged.
Thus Hor. Sat. '1.4. 105 pater optimus, ‘my worthy father! Hor. ·
S. a. 1. ra pater optime, ‘Good Sir! So in the vulgar phrase
