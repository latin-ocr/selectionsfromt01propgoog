PROPERTIVS, Ι. 8., 12-15. 189

14. provectae, ‘ advanoed on their way,' ‘having set sail,’r
used proleptically, so that auferet prouectas=‘bear thy ship away.'
The word is usually employed of ‘getting under weigh‚' as in Virg.
Aen. 3. 72 Provehimur portet, but may he used of any amount of
progress achieved however small, as in Aen. r. 24

Huc re provecti deserto in litore credunt,
where it means ‘having launched and sailed a certain distance? In
prose it is often used with longius, in the sense of ‘carried far‚' or
‘too far?

ratas. The Plur. seems used poetically, and is not inappro·
priate to the original meaning of the word which Festus, p. 273
(Mulier), gives thus: Rates vocantur tigria inter se colligata quae
per aquam aguntur, quo uocabulo interdum etiam naues ipsae signefi-
cantur. Varro, dc L. L. c. a, suggests a reason for the use of the
Plural: Ratis dicta navr's longa propter remos qued lii cum per aquas
sublati sunt dextra et sinistra duas partes· (Scaliger's coru for
rates), efficere videntur. So Plin. 3. 5. 9, 5 13 of the Tiber, trabibus
potius quam ratibus meabilis, which shows that the Plural might be
used of a single structure. The word ratis seems to have been used
by the early writers (Attius and Ennius) for ‘an oar τ’ this may have
been its original meaning, and would suit well its connection with
the root ar or ra, whence come aro, ars, arma, remus, rota, etc.
That rates here means Cynthia's vessel only seems more poetical and
natural than to suppose with Postgate that Prop. was thinking of a
crowd of vessels sturm-stayed by the same stom, and all setting sail
ἵ together. The interpretation above adopted, by which Cynthia is
supposed 10 aail in spite of high winds,is inconsistent with that
view.

15. The construction is patzbtur me defixum eiecere (se) crudelem .·
‘may she endure (to see) me stupefied with grief (and to hear me)
oft call her cruci with outstretched hand! Prof. Palmer would take
patiatur as referring to aura. vacua is added 10 intensify the sense
of the lover’s loneliness and desertion, as in 1. 18. a. The same word
in a different connection may be used 10 give a sense of complete
repose, or of a mind untroubled by thought or ca're. Cp. 3. 17. 11

Semper enim vacuos nox sobn'a torquet amantes.
defixum, ‘deadened,' ‘stupefied,' is the natural meaning; but
this, as Postgate points out, is inconsistent with infesta vocare manu
in the next line. Why should not dearum have a still simpler mean-
ing, ‘rooted to the ground t’ The picture would then be of the poet
standing in one spot, helpless to follow, but crying out upon her
cruelty with voice and hand.
