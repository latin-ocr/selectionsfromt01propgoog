Tffls again is one ol the most touching and natural of the Cynthia
poems. It is written in genuine anxiety, on the occasion ol some
serious illness oi Cynthia's. With earnest prayers for her recovery
the poet mingles admonitions‚ half serious, hals playful, that the ill-
ness has been brought onas a punishment sor some fault of her own,
either for neglect of some god, or ior lover's vows forswom. In the
contemplation oi the possibility of her death, while paying a very
touching tribute to her charms, the poet exhibits that matter-of-tact
coolness which is a constant characteristic ol the ancients in treating
ol death and its surroundiugs‚ and which conveys a feeling of insen-
sibility, almost of harduess, to the modern reader. If the ancients
had less ol the hope, they had also less of the sense of awe aud
mystery, which we feel in the contemplation os death.

Th'e poem is divided into three parts: and some editors, amongst
them Palmer, consider that they torm three distinct poems. In the
first part, ll. 1-34‚ the poet expresses his fears as to her illness, sug·
gests its cause, and both wams and comforts her by mythological ex·
amples. ln the second part, ll. 35-46‚ he fears the worst, a'nd makes
an impassioned appeal for her recovery. In the third, ll. 47-62, he
thanks Persephone lor having spared for a while longer her intended
victim‚ and bids her pay the vows due for her recovery. Baehrens,
as will be seen from the critical notes, unnecessarily turns the poem
upside down. The same illness is alluded to in 2. 9. 25
