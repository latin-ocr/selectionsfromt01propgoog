PROPERTfflS, 11. 13, 57, 583 11.28.,1-12. 249

3. The illness occurred at the most unhealthy period of the
year: the time when attention to business, according to Hor. Ep.
1. 7⁸9 Adducet febres et testaruma resignat.

8. ventus et unda rapit, an image for forgotten words or
vows‚ frequent in· the ancient poets. So Cat, qo. 3
’ Dicit: sed mulier cupida quad dicit amanti

In ,venta et rapida scribere oportet aqua.
See Ον. Am. 1. 8. 106; a. 16. 45.

9. illa. Probably ipsa should be read with Z.

paremque is the reading of Gron. adopted by most editors, aud
must be translated ‘compared, ay and placed on a level with, herself?
Palmer follows N. in reading peraeque, and in placing a mark of in·
terrogation after Venus ; and he justifies peraeque invideam by Cic.
Att. a. 19 tam peraeque amnibus ordinibus fferre. But the addition of
the essential amnibus makes all the difference, ‘to all orders equally'
Cicero could not have written peraeque ordinibus offma. Peraeque
invidiosa can hardly stand, unless it be maintained that formaris
can be equivalent to amnibusfhrmasis. That would be very harsh.

10. Prae ae, to be taken closely with formosis: ‘to those whose
beauty outshines her own?

11. remeas, emphatic epithet=‘Greek,' or rather ‘Argive,' as
Juno is esseutially the friend of the Greek or Argive cause, the enemy

of the Trajan. Scin Virg. Aen. 547 Aeneas propitiates her anger: , “

· Iuruni Argiuae iussas adolemus honores.
12. bonos, ‘beautiful’ So Ov. Met. 8. 678
Super amnia uultus
Accessere boni,

just as we speak of ‘good looks,’ ‘good-lookmg' ¹ a good head,’ etc.
To the Greeks and italiana, accustomed to dark eyes, it waslappa·
rently a moot point whether the gray or blue eye of γλαυκῶπις Ἀθήνη
could be considered a beauty; and indeed the epithet γλαυκῶπις refers
rather to the fierceness than to the colour of hereye. Curiously enough
the ancients associated fierceness with light eyes as we do with dark:
Ἰ thus Tac. Germ.4 describes the fair-haired Germans as having truces
et caerulei oculi, rutilae comae.

11, 12. tabu . . . ausa. Note how abruptly the construction
changes The tibi of l. 11 leads up to the tu to be supplied before
ama, as in 1. 6. 21, aa ,

Nam tua uon aetas umquam cessauit amori,
Semper et armatae cura fuit patriae,
where tibi has to besupplied in l. aa from tua of l. 21.
