224 NOTES.

Here, the vitium or ‘ weakness' referred to is of course Propertius'

love for Cynthia. In the preceding lines he has declared that all

maladies can be cured except love.

, 66. Tantalea meaa. 1 have retained, though not without
hesitation, the reading of the MSS, on the principle that a MS.

reading should not be rejected if a satisfactory sense can be ex-
tracted from it. Tantalea mauu, if correct, would mean ‘with the
hand of Tantalus,' or ‘with the hand of a Tantalus3’ and though
the dative would be more natural aiter tradere, it is perfectiy good
sense to speak of ‘ offering, or passing on, apples with the hand of a
Tantalus! In the Odys. 11. 581, where the position of Tantalus is
described, emphasis is laid on the fact that he cannot reach the fruit,
etc, with his hand (see the passage quoted on Tib. 1. 3, 77); and
to invert the phrase by using tradere instead of some word meaning
to reach or obtain, is quite in the style of Propertius. The point
was that Tantalus could not handle, though he could see, the apples:
so Propertius can feel, but cannot remove, his own wealrness. ‘To
hand apples ta Tantalus’ is a different idea, and imports another
person into the scene. At the same time, Tantaleae is a very
tempting correction. Propertius nowhere uses the dative in -ui : in
1‘. 11, 12 he has the contracted form ’

’ Alternae facilis cedere lympha manu,

· and again, 2. 19. 19, redderepinu Cornua. The same form occurs
Tac. Anu. 3. 30, 33, 6. 23· Horace has the similar form fiale for
fidei Od. 3. 7. 4, and Virg. Geo. 1. 208 has die for diei. The
correction to Tantalea is just the correction which an ignorant
· scribe would make. A similar doubt as between the dative and
the ablative occurs in 4 6. 22, where Palmer adopts the reading

Pilaque femineae turpiter apta manu.

Just as in this passage, Νζ reads the ablative feminea manu,
though apta (as here tradere) suggests the dative, and the dative,
on the whole, is best suited to the sense of the passage. See notes.

67. virgineis, referring to the 49 Danaids, who, for murder-
ing their husbands on their bridal night, were condemned to pour
water everlastingly into a bottomiess cask.

idem. Note the Latin idiom by which, when two pre·
dicates are referred to a common subject, the English alsa is repre-
sented not by ctiam, but by idem, agreeing with the subject. Cp·
