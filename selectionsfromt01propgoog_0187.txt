¹ roo . NOTES.

Tib. 1. 2. 91 further suggests that the blanditiae might be repeated
hythe old lover to himself:
Et sibi blanditias tumulo composuere voc'a
73, 74. Of the drunken revels and brawls of lovers.
maerere used by Liv. 35. 17 with expostulationes, by Tac. Hist.
t. 23 with querelas. The phrase is analogous to iungere amores
above l. 69.

75. The poets often speak of Love in terms anologous to those
of War. Pindar well quotes Ov. Am. 1. 9 where an elaborate com·
parison is drawn between the Lover and the Soldier. See esp. 1. 19

Ille graves urbes, hic durae limen amesae
obsidem hic portas frangit, at ille foros.

Tflts poem was written at Corcyra Messalla was despatched
direct from Aquitania on his mission to the East. Finding this
euterprise moreto his mind than the prospect of joining in the cum-
paign against Antouy in Β. c. 31, Tibullus had attached himself to
his patron. He fell ill, however, on the journey, was compelled to
remain behind at Corcyra, aud returned to Rome on his recovery.
The sad thoughts ol a sick bed and the disappointed hopes of the
adventures are curiously mingled, in a tone half serious, half playful,
with the expectation of a poetic Elysium if he die, and the picture
of a happy and uuexpected return home to Delia if he survive.

1. mtto . . . flassano. The poet first addresses the whole
cohors comitum, then specially their chief. ’

2. cohors, it must be noted, is the technical term for the
personal retinue ofa commendem not merely his military or official
stall, but all the friends who accompanied him. So Horace writing
to a friend on the staff ofTiberius in the East, Ep. 1. 8:14 ·

Ut placeat iuveni, percontare, utque cohorti ;
andCat.28.1
Pisonis comites, cohors inanis.

3. Corcyra was fixed upon by the later Greeks as the abode of
Alcinous and the Phaeacians, upon equally good authority as that
which selected the isles between Capri and Surrento as the haunt of
the Sirens, Formiae as the abode of the Laestrygones, and the bold
headland near Terracina as the dwelling of the enchantress Circe.
Cp. Ov. Am, 3. 9. 47, where Ovid alludes to this illness of
Tibullus.
