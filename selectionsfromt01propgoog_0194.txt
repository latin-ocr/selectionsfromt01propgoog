bythe earlrer Greeks oi the lower world andafuture state ,asexpressed
by Homer, and to mark the modifications introduced by Virgil mto
hisnarrative.

‘According to Homeric Geography, the earth was a flat circular

plain or disc, completely encompassed and bounded by the grean ·

stream of Ocean. The abode ol departed spirits, the kingdom of
Hades, was called Erebus, and lay under the world inhabited by
men; the entrance was placed on the western bank os the Ocean
streain, ataspot where the rivers Pyriphle ethon and Cocytus, the
latter of which' rs a branch o i‚Styx unit at a rock and pour their
waters into (the marsh oli) Acheron, Od 10. 513. The natural
· objects m this nemer-world are shadowy representations of those' rn
the world above. There is a sky, and clouds, and storms, meadows,
hills, trees, and fruita. The only thing wanting is a Snn. The
. bright light of day never penetrates into those dismal regions, which

“ Α areoverspreadbyagloomytwilight. As upon earth, good and bad

men are mingled together without distinction; the former enjoy no
reward, the latter suffer no punishment. A few only who have
ι , broken their oaths, Il. 3. 276, or openly outraged the majesty of
· heaven‚aretorturedasthe enemies of the gods. Such areTityns,‘
’ Tantalus, and Sisyphus. The ghosts ol the dead wear the same ex·

. ternal aspect as at the moment when they departed from lile, follow

’ the same pursuits, and cherish the same feelings and passions. Thus
Odysseus recognises, at once, all his former friends, as they throng ,
the edge oi the pit, sager to drink the blood of the victims which he ·

had slain. He beholds Minos grasping a sceptre, laying down laws,
and deciding the controversies os the dead, and Orion, clnb in hand,
pursuing and slaying the beasts oi chase, while Ajax, still cherishing
vindictive· wrath, turns a'way and refuses to hold communion with ·

' his former soe.

‘On the whole, the inmates of Erebus are discontented and nn-
happy, comparing their actual nothingness with their former vigour
andl power. Achilles, in reply to the compliments of Odysseus,
excarms,

Extol not death to me, illustribus chief,

For rather would I toil on earth ¹ for hire,
The beeeded servant of some needy swain,
Thon rute supreme o'er all the stadowy hosts.
