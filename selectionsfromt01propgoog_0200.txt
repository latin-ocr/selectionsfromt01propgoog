79. Danai proles. ‘ According to Apollodorus, a. 1, 4, 5,
Epaphus, son of Zeus and Io, became king of Egypt, and wedded
= Memphis, daughter oi Nilus, by whom he had a daughter, Libya
Libya bore to Poseidon twin sons, Agenor and Belus; Agenor
passed over to Phoenicia, where he reigned and became the patriarch
of a mighty tribe, while Belus remained in Egypt and married
Anchinoe, daughter of Nilus, who gave birth to twin sons,
Aegyptus and Danaus. Belus established Aegyptus in Arabia, and
Danaus in Libya; the former, by many wives, was the father oi
fifty sons, the latter of a like number of daughters. Discord having
arisen between the brothers, Danaus, learing the sons oi Aegyptus,
by the advice oi Pallas, construeted a ship and fled to Argos,
where Gelanor, the reigning monarch, surrendered to him the sove-
reignty ¹. The sons of Aegyptus followed their uncle, entreated
him to iorego his anger, ands to bestow on them his daughters in
marriage. Danaus distrusted their professions and still harboured
resentment, but consented to their proposal. On the day of-the
nuptials, aiter the marriage least, he distributed daggers to the
damsels, who murdered their husbands while asleep, all save Hy-
permnestra, who spared Lynceus. The rest were purified srom their
blood-guiltiness by Hermes and Athene at the bidding of Zeus.
Danaus, in his wrath, cast Hypermnestra² into prison, bnt aster-
wards iorgave her, and bestowed her upon Lynceus. The rest of
his daughters he offered as prizes in a gymnastic contest, and awarded
them to the victors. Apollodorus says nothing oi any punishment
inflicted on the Danaids, but other writers leigned that they were
sentenoed in the realms ol Hades to draw water in a vessel full oi
holes. Lucretius treats this asan allegory representing discontent,

Quod tamen expleri nulla ratione potestur?

numina. Note that the plural rauneina is here spoken of in
relation to a single deity. This is common in the poets: as in Virg.

At, credo, mea nuneina tandem
Fessa iacent.
