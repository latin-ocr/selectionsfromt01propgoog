(4) There is nothing in the words, of themselves, to show that Pro-
pertius meant here to identify the spot where the shipwreck took
place.v The Carpathian Sea is mentioned in 1. ra, and no doubt the
shipwreck took place in that sea. Now the Carpathian Sea lay
round the island of Carpathus, between Crete and Rhodes; and
though the Carpathian Sea was on the way to Egypt, Mount Mimas
was quite away from that course, nearly 150 miles to the north of it.
-Mr, Ellis gives various quotations as to the Carpathian Sea, but none
of them prove that the Carpathian Sea extended up the Ionian coast.
(5) The natural meaning of the words is, ‘There is a shore too that
testifies of Agamemnon's grief, where Argynnns was drowned) The
point of the illustration is not the place where the drowning took
place, but the fact that a loved youth was drowned on some shore as
Paetus was drowned. 1 take therefore the natat of F²‚ and read
Argynnus for Argynni. Qua natat is as near the reading of ΝΟ
as quae notat, and less likely to be substituted for it than vice versa.
Natat will be used in the sense illustrated in the note on 1. 8, of the
drowned body, tossed about by the waves, ‘.floundering,' and so
almost equivalent to ‘ drowned ;’ the present tense will be partly
used in place of the perfect (as referring to Argynnus) after the
manner of Propertius (see note on 4. 4. 54), partly to oonvey the
sense that Paetus is still at the mercy of the waves. To A rgynnus
the word poena is applied in much the same'sense as in 2. ao. 31

' Atque inter Tityi volucres mea poena vagatur,
where poena mea means ‘my doomed spirit! Here, as applied to
Argynnus, it will mean ‘the doom,’ almost ‘the thing punished,'
‘the victim,’ of the threatening water. ι

Lastly, the words sunt lttora may be used to indicate a spot
known, but not further named. The translation will then be, ‘There is
a shore which tells of Agamemnon’s grief,where floats Argynnus, victim
of the angry waters' Thus the attention is never turned away from the
piteous case of Paetus: every word in l. 22 applies literally to¹ him.

’ Theword poena, removed‘from Argynni, nolonger suggestsanoffence

on his part, but suggests parenthetically the innocence of Paetus,
falling a victim to the eruel angry waters. Minacis would be more
usual perhaps in this sense, but the participle is in the manner of
Propertius. Pinder's interpretation, ‘Argynnipoena aquae=Argynnus
punitus ab aqua,’ is extremely harsh.

23, 24. These lines I believe to be interpolated. They seem
to bea dull prosy commentary by some wiseacre who imagined
that the combination of ‘ Agamemnon,' ‘ shor'e,' and ‘sea,’ must neces·
sarily refer to the much-harped-on detention at Aulis. Fond as
