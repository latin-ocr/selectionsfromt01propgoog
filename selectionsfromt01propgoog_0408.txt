feet ln height—which lay claim to being the Tarpeian Rock. One ’
is on the north side, overlooking the Campus Martins; the other is
on the south-east side, faciug the Palatine, in the garden of the
modern German Hospital. The latter site suits history and the
legend best, as the Roman assault was made from the side of the .
Palatina and the Forum.

Through the den ran a little gurgllng eneam: in l. 7and through·
out the poem it is spoken of as flms, and treated indifferently asa .
stream and as a spring. Cp. fonte, sontem ll. 14, 15 with amne l. 24.

4. obstrepit . . . aquia A curiously inverted expression.
The natural construction of obstrepo is with the dative of the thing
against which the subject chafes or sounds ; but here the thing chased
against is the arbject and aquis is in the ablative: ‘The trees echo
or ring with the sound of the water.’ Cp. Hor. Epod. a. ²7

Fontesque lymphis obstrepunt manantibus,
‘roar with their waters;' and Cic. Dis. 5. 4. 1 quae res secitur tibi
litteris obstrepere non auderem, where both constructions are used.

6. pomae ire, ‘more usually potum ire,’ Palmer.

7. fontem . . . praelusit, i. e. Tatius brought his lines close
up to the som, or pool, where the Roman ganison watered. Thus
his palisade formed a kind of edge or border to the sons : and when
Tarpeia came down to draw water, the Sabines, bivonacking in the
forum, were in full view.

8. coronat, as we speak of a ‘ring-fence'

9. omens, ie. ‘Sabine' Propertius apparently alone uses
this form. In Ov. Fast. 3. 94 the form Curensis is used, as by Varro
and Pliny. Cures, -e'um is the town.

11. dicuntur lura, ‘law is administered!

13. ‘They had a mountain for their wall!

ubi, etc, ie the fims was on the site where afterwards the
curia Hostilia was built, the special meetingplace, first of the aeriae,
afterwards of the Senate. Close to the curia Hostilia was the famous
Carcer or Mamertine prison, known anciently as Tullianum. Now
the name Tullianum is derived from an old word tullius, signifying
a spring, and in reality means ‘ Well·house.’ There is a well still to
be seen in the prison': itis therefore possible that thefom of Tarpeia
is none other than the tullius of the prison, the sight of which wrung
from Jugurtha his last words: ‘O Romans, how cold your bath isl'
See Bum's Rome, p. 81, etc.

14. This line is apparently a general description of the spring,
without special allusion to the Sabines or Romans. The spring was
apparently outside the lines of both armies: Aquam fme ea tum
