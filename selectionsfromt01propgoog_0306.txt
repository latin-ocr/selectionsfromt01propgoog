properaturarum, 1-6· 239

‘man of sense’ The distinction between senuas and mens, appropriate
elsewhere, is here ont ol place; more parallel are such phrases as
latet in animo ac sensu meo Cic. de Leg. 2. 1, or ut id maxime
excellat quod longissime se't ab imperitorum intelligentia sensuque
disiunctum de Orat. 1. 3, and especially the phrase communis
sensus, ou which so much has been written: see Lucr. 1. 422

Corpus enim perse communis dedicat esse
Sensus.

Cp. Mayor on an 8. 73, where communis sensus is said to be
wanting to the man who is inordinately pulled up by his pedigree‚
just as Hor. S. 1. 3. 66 says the same of the man who seuselessly
interrupts another who wishes to read or to be quiet. Deficient in
‘tact' we should say: i.e. in that amount of sense aud intelligence
and jndgment which we expect to find in our lellow-creatures.
‘Without sense' or ‘thought' will suit the·present passage:

ἀφρόντιστος, as Postgate points out, is similarly used of Love by
Theocritus ιο. 19.

4.1ev1bus cuns, an ablative of cause, to be ‘taken with
perire, which is equivalent to the uunsed passive of the verb
ra’er.
pc adria, as frequently in love poems, is equivalent to ‘love' or
‘the loved object? For the former sense cp. Ov. Rern. Am. 311
Haeserat iu quadam nuper mea cura puella,·

ior the latter, Prop. 2. 34. 9
Lyncea, tune meam potanti, perfide, curam
Tangere?
Cp. the Greek ἐμὸν μέλημα.
bona, all solid advantages: not wealth only.
ventosas. So Virg. Aen. 12. 848: ‘light and airy!

6. reott, the regular word for artistic representation: as in
Ovid. Met. 6. 109

Fecit olom'ne‘s Ledam recubare sub alis,
or to representation by words, as in Cic. N. D. 1. 12. 31 Xenophon

¹ - facit Socratem disputantem.

The latter part ol the liue is difficolt. Paley, following Hertz„
translates ‘to flit in the human heart,’ which seems grotesque ; how,
without absurdity, can we talk of Cupid fitted with wings iu order
to ‘ily in the hearti' Postgate also makes corde the ablative of
place, and supposes that in the picture Love was represented as
‘ilylng irom heart to beart? This sense, however, is clearly not to
be got out ol the words humano corde ,· aud so Postgate suggests that
