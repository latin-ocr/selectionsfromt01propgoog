this interpretation weakens the point of the passage, which consists
in the depreciation of all Rome's worthies in comparison to Augustus

ΙΙΙ. 18.

Tffls poem is an elegy upon the early death of M. Claudius Mar·
cellus in Β. c. 23, rendered so famous by the touching lines of Virgil,
Aen. 6. 861-887, and by the splendid generosity with which Octavia
is said tc have rewarded them. In no passage is the delicate and
refined pathos of Virgil more nobly exhibited thau in this, as he
brings before us the bearing and the promise of the youthful Marcellus,
the untold loss to Rome from his untimely death, the universal
mouming of the people. The premature death of Marcellus, in his
twentieth year, was the first of the series of family losses which fell
so thickly on Augustus, and which cut off one by one all the hopes
which he had formed as to the succession. Marcellus was own
nephew to Augustus, being the son of his sister Octavia ancl of the
zealous Pompeian C. Claudius Marcellus, who had done so much
during his consulship in Β. c. 50 to hurry on the rupture between
Pompey and Caesar. As early as uc. ²9 Augustus brought the
young Marcellus into public notice: in' n. e. 25 he seemed formally ¹
to mark him out as his heir by at once adopting him as his son, and
giving to him his own daughter Julia in marriage, in addition to
other honours. In Β. c. 24 he was elected curule aedile; in nc. 23
he had performed the duties of that office with great magnifi-
cence when he was struck down by a fatal disease, of which he died
after a short illness at Baiae, under the care of Augustus’ favourite
physician, Antonius Musa, who had vainly applied the same hot·

’ water treatment which he had found so successful before in the case

of Augustus himself. The nature of the illness was unknown: and
as ¹ Rumour is ever dark when dealing with the deaths of princes:
we are not surprised to find that there were suspicions cf foul play.
The series of catastrophes which cut off all Augustus’ natural heirs
built up the fortunes of Livia’s family: it was but natural, therefore,
that she should be believed to have plotted the deaths by which the
ambition of her life was gratified (Dion Cass. 53. 33). That the
suspicion attached equally to every case, without regard to evidence,
together with the fact that she retained the love and confidence of
Augustus to the last, is the best proof that the suspicion wasia all
cases alike unfounded.
