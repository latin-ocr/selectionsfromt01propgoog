be the oldest and most authoritative of all. Baehrens
dates it about 1430: he regards it therefore as a MS. of
the interpolated type, belonging to the same family as
A. F ., but taking some of its readings for D. V.‚ and dis-
figured in some places by Italian conjectures, in others
by reproducing the corrections of Fi. and V'. But M.
Plessis, as we have seen, upsets Baehrens¹ dates on

palaeographic grounds: he makes N. some 200 years ¹

older, V. some 50 years younger, than does Baehrens:
while he regards A. D. F. as being all about the same
age, viz. of the end of the fourteenth century. F urther,
both Mr. Ellis¹ and M. Plessis have pointed out various
passages in which A. F.D.V. are all corrupt, while N. alone
has preserved the true reading: while both F. Leo and

M. Plessis point out that wherever F2. and Vl. agree with' .

Ν., the reading is correct. In addition, N. is distinctly
superior in orthography; it does not give the false name
of Aurelius or Nauta to the poet 3 and Mr. Ellisl has in·
geniously shown that even in passages where it blunders,
it blunders because the copyist preferred faithfully to
copy the MS. before him, rather than introduce obvious
corrections. Finally, M. Plessis’ view as to the date of N .
is confirmed by Mr. E. Maunde Thompson, of the British
Museum‚ an authority of the highest mark ².

From these arguments the conclusion remains that N ‚
is the best existing Ms, being the oldest representative
of the familyAF.; that D.V. form another family, equal to
A. F. but inferior to N. ; that the corrections of F². and Ψ.
have been largely taken from N. or from some equally
good MS. ; while G. and H. G. have mixed in an ¹uncer-
tain degree the readings of the two families. A careful
