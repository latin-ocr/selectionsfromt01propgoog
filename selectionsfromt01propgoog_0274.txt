PROPERTJUS, 1. 19.,·2-s. 207

clnng to them so firmly that it was inconceivable that he should '
leave him when dead, and allow his remains to be neglected by her
whom he had loved, is a perfectly natural and beautiful idea· The
idea of the‘Anthology is quite different ThereVenus, or ure
ministersos Venus, anoiut their eyes with bird-lime that they may
catch the love13 here Love has fastened himself so firmly ou to the
lover's eyes, that he cannot be torgotten by love, even after death.
The old song says ' “
Leve in lter eyes sits playz'ng;
Shakespeare thinks it necessary to controvert the common opinion,
when he says,
Leve looks not with tha eyes but with tlte mind.

6. oblito, generally taken in a passive sense, asin Virg. E. 9.
53 Nunc oblita milii tot carmina. So also Val. Flac. a. 38. 8.
But is this necessary? Could it not be taken in aquasi-proleptic
sense, to mean ‘Love has not clnng so lightly to my eyes that my
ashes can be left untended by a forgettiug love’ L. 3 shows that
the amm is not his love sor her, but hens sor him; it is her forget-
sulness of him which he dreads. Thus oblito ansere vacet means
‘shall lie unhonoured by a love—a love that has forgotteu me.v
In other words, there is a double predication combined in one ex-
pression, He might either have said ‘that my ashes should be
unhonoured by Love,' or that ‘Love should be forgetful of my
ashes? Here both phrases are welded into oue. Moore brings out
this meaning:

Too well I've loved, too blindly‚ that my bier
Should be unhonoured ly a single tear.

Pinder’s explanation ‘Not even in death will thy love be for·
gotten by me’ misses the point. Is it possible that vacet may be
used absolutely, ‘lack the honour due to it,' as uncultivated lands
are said vacare? Oblita amore would then be the ablative absolute,
‘my love forgetting: ‘through the sorgetlulness of my love! Cp.

7. l’hylacides. Protesilaus is meant, whose father Iphiclus
was son of Phylacus. The love of Protesilaus sor Laodamia is
well-known from Ov. Her. 13. He obtained leave from the gods
to return to see her fora single day.
