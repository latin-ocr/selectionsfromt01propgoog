PROPERTIUS, I. 18„ 21-31-19, 1. 205

beto the commonplace subject of the, excluded lover, pouring out

his sorrows to the door which shuts him out. See the whole poem, -

1.16. Baehrens' conjecturesuliis1stempting Itis in harmony
with the piece, containing a pathetic assurance on the part of the
poet, in the very moment that recalls to him his wrongs, that he has
breathed them to none but the silent leaves.

quae is a general neuter, referring to curas: ‘matters which
are known only etc

25. Note the contrast of timidus and superbae.

26. uento . . . dolone, a grief that vents itself in words.

27. The address to the Fonntains and their Naiads, implied in
the usual punctuation, is somewhat abrupt, and it seems better to
leave the question open whether fontes is the nominative or the
vocative. The only reason for supposing it to be the latter is con-
κ tained iu the epithet divini, which is inconsistent with frigida,
inculto, dura, all pointing to the hardships of the poet’s present
surroundings. But this is ontweighed by the ambiguity and harsh·
ness of taking the words out of their natural sequence : diuini fhntcs
et frigida rupes et. . . dura quies„ The conjecture dumosi montes
is quite unnecessary. Mr. R. Ellis, Journal of Phil. vol. xv. p. 12,
has made the ingenious conjecture Clusini sontes. Divini is out
of place; and he suggests a coincidence with the passage in Horace,
Epp. 1. 15. 5, where Horace complains that Baiae and its hot
springs were being deserted for the cold founts of Clusium. Pro-
pertius, sick with love or ill, may have retired for change of air to
Clusium, and poured forth this eighteenth elegy in some unfre-
quented spot in the neighbourhood.

29, 30. These lines give some support to the reading foliis in
l. 243 the two couplets obviously correspond to each other.

31. cynthia, i. e. ‘the name “ Cynthia,”' being the object to
vacem.

Ι. 19(

A beautiful and touching elegy, written apparently in anticipation
of an early death, aud, with the exception of the relief afforded by
the two concluding lines, in a tone of deep despondency. The poet
is filled with terror at the thought that Cynthia may forget him
when dead, while he vows that his own love will endure beyond the
grave. Let them eujoy their love, at least, while they live.

1. versor, seldom if ever used with exactly the same sense
as timeo or metuo. Cicero carefully distinguishes the words, Seu.
