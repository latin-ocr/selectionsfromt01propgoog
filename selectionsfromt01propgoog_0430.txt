PROPERTJUS, IV. 11., 39·47· 363

Achffll is as good a form as Achillis, and is best supported here
ythe MSS.

40. proavo . . . Achille. The taunting repetition of these
ords is similar to Horace's libertino patre natum Sat. 1. 6. 6,
c., a taunt against himself which he repeats several times, half in
ide, half in imitation.

The late Mr. Munro's great reputation makes it worth while to
ate shortly his view of this whole passage. Rejecting the MS
ading os l. 40 on every ground of grammar, sense, and matre, he
{lieves that awhole distich has fallen ont, 1. 38 beginningwith Ei or
t qui, and that lor Achille, l. 40, we are to look for some other pro-
ma of Perses, to enhance still more the glory of his conqueror
emilius Paulus. Suggesting first that this proavus may be Alex-
ider, he proposes either Atossa or Amastri, two famous Persian
reens, who would stand sor the royal house of Persia: but finally he
lieres Alexander’s paternal descent from Hercules to be alluded to,
id Hercules himself to be described by reference to his last and
eatest achievement, his breaking ‘into Hades, dragging away Cer·
erus, and restoring Theseus to the light. Thus byaprocess of reason·
g tmly marvellous, and by a display of wholly irrelevant learning,
:has persuaded himself that Propertius wrote the passage thus t

Testor maiorum cineres tibi Roma verendos,
Sub quorum titulis, Africa, tonsa iaces,

Et qui contuderunt animos pugnacis Hiberi ·
Hannibalemque armis Antiochumque suis,

Et Persen moavi simulantem pectus Achilli,
Quique tuas proavus fregit, Avenae, dorios

Me neque censurae legem mollisse, etc.

This is indeed rescribere, non emendare, Propertium with a ven
auce. Plessis reads feras for tuas.

41. Referring to her husband’s censorship. He had no need, on
r account, to relax the severity of his office.

42. maa emphatid3 ‘by no stain of mine?

43. mum, for the more usual damno. See note on 2. 10. 6
idacio certe Laus erit.

45. aetas, well explained hy Postgate, ‘I throughout my lite?
t 1. 6. 21

Nam tua non aetas umquam cessavit amori,
e. ‘ You have never yet, in all your life, been in love.’ Cp. 2. 5. 27.

46. Cp. Ov. Her. 21. 172

Et sace pro thalami fax mihi mortis erit.
47. An amplification of the proverb Noblesse obliga. Cp. Eur.
