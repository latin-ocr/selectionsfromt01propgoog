TO PROPERTJUS. xxxix

Like most well-educated young men of his time, he
seems to have been intended for the bar; but we are
not surprised that, with his temperament, like ovid, he
should have found the contentions os the iorum intoler-
able, 4. 1. 133

Tum tibi pauca suo de carmine elz'ctat Apollo,
El vetat iruano uerba tonare foro.

‘Then Apollo taught thee somewhat oi his own gift oi
song, and forbad thee to thunder in the mad contests
of the forum!

The date of his birth can only be fixed approximately.
Our only certain infonnation on the subject is derived
from ovid, Trist. 4. ro. 41—54. ln that passage Ovid
gives a list of the poets whom he had known in his youth.

Having first named Aemilius Macer of Verona, author of
a poem on birds ¹snakes and herbs, he proceeds :

Saepe suos solitus recitare Propertius c'gues,
Iure sodalicii qui milii iunctus erat.
Ponticus heroo, Bassus quoque clarus iambis,
Dulcia convictus membra suere mei,
Detinuit nostras numerosus Horatius aures,
Dum ferit Ausonia camina culta lyra.
Vergilium uidi tantum: nec amara Tibullo
ljempus amicitiae fata dedere uuae.
Successor fuit liic tibi, Galo ,· Propertius illi;
Quartus ab liis serie temporis ipse sui.

‘Oft would Propertius recite tome his loves, close
bound to me by bond os comradeship. Ponticus, iamed
in Epic verse, Bassus too in lambio, were dearly-loved
members os my hand. Horace with his tuneful numbers
held my ears fast-bound as he struck his polished lays
from the lyre of Italy. Virgil l did but see: nor did
the unkindly lates give Tibullus time to be my friend,
He was thy successor, Gallus, and Propertius his: fourth
from them was l in order of the time!
