T IBULLUS, Ι. 10., 32-51· ἢ 155

’ Pernesse's can only refer to striking the cheeks, perscisse's to

tearing them in grief: neither is appropriate as applied to the

shades of themselves. Exese's, the conjecture of Heinsius, makes
the best sense, but involves a great change in the text.

“ 40. occupas, ‘comes upon him,‘ ‘ overtakes him,' with the im·

plication ‘before he is aware of it'

42. Cp. Hor. Epod. 2. 4²·

46. unsaros, to be taken closely with duxit.

48. testa pestana. ‘The amphora stored up, or laid in, by
his father? Cp. Ov. Α. Α. 2. 695

Qui properant, nova musta bibant; milvi fundat avitum
Consulibus priscis condita testa enarum.

The amphora was the earthenware vessel iu which wine was kept
stored up for use, after all the processes of making had been gone
through. Though holding over five and a half quarts, it was thus
the counterpart of the modern hottle; it was long in sinape, had two

in some sacred grove close by: so Hor. Od. 1. 4. 11 of spring,

Hic amor, hec studium ; dnm sacra secundm haruspex
Ι Nuntiet, ac lucos vocet hostia pinguis in altos.

From such a feast it would appear that the father might be
expected to come home in the same condition as too many a modern
