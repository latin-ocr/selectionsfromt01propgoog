PROPERTIUS,111. 7.‚ 51-64. 30¹

57-64 This last dying speech affords a striking example os
the artificiality os ancient poetry, and especially of that of ὼε Alex·
andrine school. To a modern ear such a speech, iu the mouth of a
drowning man, choked with salt water, would be absurd: but it '
must be remembered that speeches were an essential part ot the
stock in trade oi an ancient writer, whether of history or poetry.
Such speeches are not intended to represent what any actual person
ever said, or was supposed to have said; they merely sum up, in a
pictorial way, ὼε view of ὼε situation taken by the author, or that
which he supposes to have been taken by a bystancler.

57. The gods of the Aegeau'are the winda: Horace calls Notus
ὼε arbiter Hadriae Od. 1.3. 1 5¹ and Auster ffleDux inquieti turbidus
Hadriae 3. 3. 5 ς but that is not the same as calling them gods. Nor
does Virg. Aen. 1. 5², sqq. assign to Aeolus any dominion over the
sea, but only over the winds and storms.

58. degravat, ‘weighs down,' ‘sinks’

59. miuron primae lanuginis annos=me misenam e'n p. l.
aetate. So nostram vitam lor me 3. 11. r. Postgate refers to the
imitation in Ov. Her. 15· 85.

60. langueremus, of the delicate tapering hands of a boy.
A long hand was admired, P'rop. a. a. 5.

61. alcyonum scopulis, i.e. ‘rocks haunted by halcyons,’ and
consequently wild and rugged.

62. tuscha (florea l) athree- (or four-l pronged spear (τρίαινα),
used by fishermen for spearing fish, aud given as an attribute to
Neptune. It was used as a weapon by the gladiator called retiarius,
who first endeavoured to entangle his adversary with his net, and
then attacked him with the fuscina. Cp. Juv. a. 143 and Hom.
Od. 5. 292.

63. evehat. So the MSS.: ‘throw me ashore at3' not very
satisfactory. Advelrot has been proposed. But Postgate quotes Ov.
Her. 18. 197, where Leander, before crossing the Hellespont, says

Optabo tomen ut partes expellor e'n illos.
Euclea is frequently used of passengers by sea, as Liv. 37. 15 placuit
tomen Regillum classe tota evelti adponam Ephesi.

64. cte me, to be taken closely with ltoc: ‘this remnaut of me‚'
‘these remains os mine,’ ‘will be enough, if only,’ etc.

With ffle idea of this line conipare Lycidas:

Ay mel whilst tltee tlte shores, and sounde'ng sear

Wosla far away, where'er thy' boues are leurl'd,
Whetlaer beyond tlte stormy Hele-ides,

Wlure thou perhaps under tlee whelme’ug tifle
