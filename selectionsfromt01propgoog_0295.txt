NOTES.

ll. 3.

The poet enlarges on the charms of Cynthia, which justify the
absorhing character of his passion.

1. nocere, of the harm, damage, or ‘wonnding' caused by
love. Postgate defends the MS. reading nullum.

2. epla-itus, i. e. the poet's boasting that he had cast himself
clear of his love, and was a free man once more. For spiritus,
‘breath,’ in the sense of pride and boasting, cp. Hor. Sat. a. 3. 311

Corpore maiorem rides Turbonis in aronis

Spiritum et incessum.
The similar nse in the Scottish dialect of the word ‘wind' is well
illustrated in the Litany ascribed to the ancestor of the present
Mr. MaxtoneGraham of Cultoqnhey. Laird ofa small property,
surrounded by four great families, he daily prayed at ‘the wishing
well’ of the domain:

From tho croft off thr Campbells‚
From thr pride of tho Grasmrs,
From the iro of tho Dmmmondr,
From the wind cy tho Morays,
Good Lord, deliver us.

4. liber alter. These words are generally referred to the
publication of the First book of the Elegies‚ as though within one
month the poet began the writing of the Second (see Introd.).
But the reference might be merely to a temporary abjurement of
Cynthia-perhaps the same as that referred to in a. a. 1 Liber eram,
etc-and the libor might only be a maxima historia, or one of the
longas Iliadas which the beauty of Cynthia was perpetually forcing
from him, a. 1. 16, 14.

5. quaerebam-ar, ‘I was casting about to see if,' ‘I was
trying to discover whether;’ and then follow two impossibilities to
show the futility of the attempt to give up his love.

6. leo nontu- is here equivalent to orl si non solitus or inso-
litus, as is evident from a comparison of si posset l. 5 with si possem
l. 7. The use of noc as equivalent tort non is frequent in cases where
the negative qualifies the whole sentence which follows. But here
Propertius uses noc in such a way that its negative only qualihes the
single word solitus. vSo in 2. 28, 52

Vobiscum Europe noc proba Formiae,
noc probo is equivalent to et non probo or et improba. Similarly
