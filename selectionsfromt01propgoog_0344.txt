propasome, 111. 3., 35-52. 277

stent. . assungur. . nectet. The meaning must be ‘let all these
events be nothing, i. e. ol no consequence, in thine eyes!

refringat. Cp. Hor. Od. 3. 3. 28.

45. Some word equivalent to ‘ how,' ‘iu what fashion,' has to
be gathered from quibus in campis to· connect vectet with what goes
belore. The allusion is apparently to the deleat ol Ariovistus by
Caesar in B.c. 58. Ariovistus had entered Gaul to assist the Aedui
against the Sequani at the head ol various German tribes, among
whom were the Sucoi, a vague name assigned byCaesar to the tribes
occupying the East bank oi the Rhine. Caesar’s victory was gained
at a spot fisty miles from the Rhine: the defeated fled across the
. river, some swimming, some in small beata, among whom was Ario·
vietus. Clearly Propertius had but dim ideas as to the site.

pemeus, as if the surlace ol the water ran with blood.

47. coronatos, ol revellers who have just lelt a feast.

48. ebria, the epithet is transferred from the revellers to the
traces of their escapade. See above note on 3. 1. 8.

49. stamme, whence our ‘excantation,¹ used here in its
literal sense. Cp. Merchant os Venice a. 5, where the Jew in vain
warns Jcssica:

'chr you me, Jcssr'ca:
Lock up my deors ; and when you hear tlu dmm
And tlte vile squeaking of tlte wrynuckodfifa
Clambor not thou up to tlte casamenti then,
Nor tlrrust your lead into nu public street
To gaze on Christian sools with vamisludfaces,
But stop my house’s ears, I ruean my casnnents¹

50. austeres droa, ‘severe husbands‚’ or possibly ‘cur-
mndgeon fathers’ such as Shylock himself. In the former case,
pznllas would be ‘young wives? tertre, ‘to cheat,' ‘gall’

52. ora rigavit, a prool that parva orn, l. 5,relers to the lips.
Postgate quotes Ov. Am. 3. 9. 23, where the lips ol poeta are said to be
watered by Homer as bya perennial lount. Our own ‘Augustan'
poeta are fond ol introducing the inspiring springs ol the Muses: cp.
Pope, Essay on Criticism,

A little learning is a dangerous thing ;

Drink donner toste nottho Pierian spring.
And the same Propertian vein is to be discemed in the pride and
'care which Pope lavished on his grotto at Twickenham.
