to our ‘setting sail.'

comes from ‘making light’ in a scale, and so ‘depreciating’

11-20. Propertius first prays that his prayer may be heard, and
that Cynthia may not beable to sail; then, imagining her ship started,
he hopes that the winds which have not deterred her may still rage
around her, while he, stupefied with grief, rates her for her cruelty
from the shore. Then repenting of his crnel'words, he hopes that
after all she may have a prosperous passage. Postgate follows those
editors who invert the order of the two distichs ll. 13-16, partly to
give tales a better meaning, partly to assist a supposed symmetrical
division of the poem into passages of 4, 4, 6, 6, 6 lines respectively,
each giving a complete thought. But the change is unnecessary, for
(1) tales has a good sense as given above, referring to the heroe and
stormy winds which he has hoped may prevent her from sailing alto-
gether. These winds he hopes, in his anger, may still continue after
she has set sail, and that she may have the further agony of seeing
and hearing him upbraiding her from the shore. (a) Atqu· sco
will thus have its natural sense, instead of ‘And yet’ as required by
Postgate’s order. (3) Symmetrical divisions should be regarded with
much suspicion. They may be multiplied indefinitely to suit the
caprice of editors, and once the principle of transposition is admitted
it cannot be kept within reasonable limits. An examination of the
transpositions suggested in Propertius by recent editors, with the
reasons for them, will convince a sober critic that his safest course is
to take and explain the order as he finds it in the best MSS, rather
than to expeud ingenuity in showing how our poet might have been
more symmetrical or logical in his arrangement. The English head-
ings given in this edition will, it is hoped, serve to bring out that the
order of the MSS. is in almost every case natural and intelligible;
and in this case there are no corresponding divisions in the second
part of the Ode.
