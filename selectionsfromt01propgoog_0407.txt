Liv. r. 11, Ov. Fast. 1. 261 sqq. The account now generally accepted is
that there was originally a Latin settlement on the Palatine bill, a
Sabine (l) settlement on the Quirinal and Capitol. and that the infant
Rome was formed by the anion oi the two. Roman pride could not
admit that the Capitol was not originally Roman,·and so represented
it as having been lost by treachery. See Tac. Ann. ra. 24. ’

8. 1. 4. Propertius means that the approach to the Capitol was
through a rocky thickly·wooded den or gorge, the rocks (antro)
being covered with ivy. All these points occur in Virgil's descrip-

' and exaggerated, but it is vain to look for real topographical

accuracy in the poets. or indeed the historicus, oi Rome. The
. Roman historiens are notoriously inexact and vague in such
matters. Livy never helps us in his descriptione of ground, even as
to great battlefields which he might easily bave visited. And even
the careful Greek Polybius, who laboriously went over the soenes of
the* campaigns which be narrates, never describes a locality with the
point and precision which are necessary for identification. The
Capitol has been so overlaid with buildings and ruins that it is im·
