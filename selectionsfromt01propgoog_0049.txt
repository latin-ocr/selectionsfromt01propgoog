of 3. 25. 2? Are the words potui serwz're fideliter incon·
sistent with that hypothesis? The general opinion has
been that they are inconsistent with it; and this is the
view of Lachmann. He holds further thatin 3. 15. 7, 8,
, where the poet speaks of an attachment for Cynthia of
at least two years' standing, he must refer to a period
previous to the year ol separation, so that the whole
period of the poet's connection with Cynthia must in
that case have extended over at least eight years. But
it is evident from the Cynthia elegies that there were
frequent quarrels and frequent reconciliationsbetween the
lovers: their love was subject to all the vicissitudes of
caprice, disappointment, and satiety‚ which might be
expected to arise between two persons of ardent but
sensitive temperament, incapable of sels-control, and
innocent of all restraint from moral or prudential con·
siderations. It were idle to look for five years of un·
broken calm between such a pair; and a whole year of
interrupted relations might well be overlooked‘in a rapid
and indignant retrospect. Literal exactness is not to be
looked for in the protestations of a lover when at the
moment of a final rupture he recalls his devotion in the
past: and M. Plessis is doubtless right in holding that
when Propertius declares he had been fo‘r five years the
faithful slave of Cynthia, he meant to indicate the whole
duration of their attachment. It affords a strong cor·
roboration of this view, that the whole series of Cynthia
poems, so far as we can put an exact date upon them,
covers as nearly as possible a period of five years. N one
of these elegies can be definitely ascribed to an earlier Ι
date than Β. c. 28: none can definitely be put later than
Β. e. 23. There are many, no doubt, to which no date at
all can be assigned, and there are difficulties in the way
of any chronological scheme that can be constructed: but
the fact that some ten or twelve ol the elegies, spread over
the three first books, can be dated, and that all fall within
