The date of the poet’s death is fixed by the Epigram of
Domitius Marsus, mentioned above :

T e quoque Vergilio comitem ,non aequa, Tibulle,
Mors iuvenem campos misit ud Elysios,

Ne foret, aut elegis molles qui fleret autores,
Aut caneret forti regia bella pede.

‘Thee too, in Virgil's company, Tibullus, unkindly
Death despatched yet young to the Elysian fields, that
there might be none either to sing the tearful elegies of
love, or to tell in brave measure of the wars of kings’

Now Virgil died at Brundusium on the 22nd Sept„

lae. 19, and the words of Domitius imply that Tibullus = ¹]
’ Ι died at the same time, or at least shortly afterwards.

¹3 We may therefore assume that his death took place at
: the end of B. e. 19, or the beginning of B. c. 18.

As to the date of his birth, however, there is more «
uncertainty. ln the Third Book of the Elegies, there
occurs the following passage, 5. 17, 18

Natalem nostri primum uidere parentes
Quum cecidit fato comul uterque pari.

‘My parents saw my first birthday what time the two
consuls fell by a common fate!

If this couplet were genuine, it would fix the date of
the poet’s birth definitely to tae. 43, when the consuls

’ Hirtius and Pansa fell before the walls of Modena. But

almost all ‘scholars are now agreed in regarding the
Third Book as not being the work of Tibullus; and,
even were it otherwise, this particular passage must be
regarded as an interpolation for the following reasons :—

(1) The second of the two lines occurs verbatim in Ovid,
Trist. 4. 10. 6, who tells us of his own birth :

Editus hic ego rum ; nec non, attemperet tzaris,
Cum cecidit sato comul uterque puri.

‘Here was Ibom: and that thou may'st know the time,
it was when, etc.²
