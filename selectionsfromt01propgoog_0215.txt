148 nores,

This seems to be connected with the ancient doctrine, Macrob. Sat.
1. 10, that the souls of men prooeeded from Jupiter, and after death
were restored to him again. We can thus understand how a Genius
might be attributed to the gods themselves-the Genii being, accord·
ing to this view, agents who executed their will; and, in fact, we
read of Genius Iouiale's1, Genius Inflrnus (Fabrett. Inscrip. a. 71),
Genius Plutonis (Gruter. Inscrip. 10738), Genius Priapi (Petron.
Arb. ai), Genius Famae (Mart. 7. ιι), aud the like. It is possible,
however, that these are mere circumlocutions, indicating the divinities
themselves)

49. The MS. reading centum ludos geniumque is insupportable,

as involving a harsh zeugma. ‘Celebrate a hundred gemes and ’

(honour) the Genius with a dance.' Genium ludo geniumque choreis,
adopted by Hiller, is no better. The probability is that the two
words genium and centum, being so extremely like one another, got
accidentally interchanged, and that the true reading is that of the
text, genium ludo centumque choreis. The change from lude to ludos
would naturally follow from the misplacement of centum, and the
sense requires centum to go with the second substantive, not the first,
and thus create a climax. Chorea is usually found in the plural, so
that centum is quite a permissible exaggeratiom and harmouises with
niulto in the next line. See Prop. 1. 3. 5; 3. 10. 23; Hor. Od. ι. 19.
25; Ov. Met. 8. 746.

tempora. The brow of the Genius was to be moistened with
wine, just as his hair was to run down with unguents. As above
explaiired, the Genius was in all respecta the representative and
counterpart of the man himself.

51. nuuc, sc. Genii: seea. a. 5seqq. quoted above. The' image
of the Genius, ιιι the form of a youth, stood m the atrium· on festal
days it was adorned with wreaths and unguents; viands and wine
were placed before it.

53. hodierne, for hodie. Or it may be the vocative by a con-
fusion οἱ construction, as in Pers. S. 3. 28 '

Stemmata quod Tusco ramum millesime ducis.
honores here means ‘a complimentary offering: ‘an offering
paid as an honour? The word honor is generally used not with a
mere abstract meaning, but with the additional sense of some external
or material result. Thus honor, hencres, arethe characteristic words
to use for any of the great offices of the state. See Juv. Sat. 1. 117
Sed quum summus dener finite computet anno.
