victory of Actium is celebrated, and the book closes
with the magnificent Elegy on the noble matron Cor-
uella. Two of the poems of this book, and two only,
can be dated. These are the sixth and eleventh, both ol
which must he referred to the year Β. c. 16. The former
was written to commemorate the celebration of the
ludi quinquennalem the latter, l. 66, alludes to the con·
sulship of Ρ. Cornelius Scipio, both of which events took
place in that year. Most editors are agreed in holding
that the whole book was published posthumously. Be·
yond the year Β. c. 16, says Mr. Postgate, ‘there is not
a shred for conjecture to lay hold os, and the ohscurity
which wraps so much of the poetry of Propertius sinkS,
like a pall, upon his life? =

It has generally been supposed that the antiquarian
poems of the Fourth Book-the first, second, fourth, ninth
and tenth-were written in the poet’s first youth, and before
the Cynthia period of his life. But there is no proos for
this hypothesis; nor is it supported by any evidence to
be extracted from the poems themselves. Alike in suh·
ject and in treatment they display a calmness and a
continuity altogether foreign to the rapid fervour and
exuberant passionateness of the poet’s earliest days;
they seem a very fultilment ol the poet's own promise
in 3. 5. 19 sqq„ that while devoted to Love and Bacchus
in his hot youth, he will turn, with advancing age, to graver
themes. Now had Propertius turned to antiquarian sub-
jects in his youth, we may be certain that he would have
gone to the mythology of Greece sorbis subject. When he
began to write, he was saturated with the forms and the
spirit oi Greek mythology3 he had carried an imagination
and an enthusiasm into the study which burst through
all the artificial wrappings in which his Alexandrine
masters had embedded it; but there is nothing in his
earlier poems to show that he had expended any interest
