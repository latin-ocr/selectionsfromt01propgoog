In the last four lines of the passage, it is evident that
Ovid places the elegiae poets in a chronological order
(sem‘e temporis) in relation to each other. What he
means to say is that Gallus was first in the series, then

came Tibullus, then Propertius, whilst he himself closed .

the list as fourth in order from Gallus. A doubt has in·
deed been raised as to this interpretation in consequence
of the two pronouns iric and illi being used in reference
to the same person, viz. Tibullus: but there is no real
difficulty in this, for as the subject of the sentence changes

from Tibullus to Propertius, Tibullus is properly referred
to as bic in the former clause, as ille in the latter. An

exactly parallel instance occurs in Juv. 11. 23-5

Illum ego iure
Despiciam qui scit quanto sublimior Atlas
Omnibus in Libya sit momibus, bic tamen idem
Ignorat quantum serrata distet ab arca

Sacculus,

ie. ‘That man I should rightly despise who knows the
height of Atlas, and who yet does not know,' etc. Here

illum and bic refer to one and the same person, who
is spoken of as illum when object, as bic when sub-

ject, to the verb. We thus establish the chronological
sequence, (1) Gallus, (2) Tibullus, (3) Propertius, (4)
Ovid. Now the poet ·C. Cornelius Gallus was born
either in Β. c. 69 or 66 and died ac. 26; Tibullus was
bom possibly as· early as Β. c. 59, certainly not later than
Iac. 54, and died probably ue. 183 Ovid, lastly‚ was
born tac, 43, and died A.D. 18. We have thus to find a
date for the birth of Propertius between the years ae. 59
or 54 and Β. c. 43. We have already seen that he was a
boy in the years Β. e. 42 and 41, old enough to be spoken
of as the owner of property (4. 1. 129), and to be affected
by the events of the Perusian war3 but his education was
not completed, and an interval must be left, correspond-
ing to mox in 4. 3. 131,for his residence at Rome previous
to his assumption ol the manly gown in his sixteenth or
