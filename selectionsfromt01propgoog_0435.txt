tamen* marks the contrast between the devotion to her contem-
plated in the preceding lines and the possibility of a second marriage.

advenam, because the lectus gemelr's was placed in the atrium
facing the door. The door is here said to change the bed, either
because it saw the change, or because the beds, old and new, had to
pass through it. Propertiusallows himself great latitude in his choice
of a subject for a sentence. ,

86. cauta, implying rather the quality needed, than that‘
necessarily exhibited, by a stepmother.

87. ‘Speak well of and put up with? Either one of these two
by no means necessarily implies the other.

90. verreria offanae· suaa, ‘will turn or interpret them into
(i. e. as intended for) an attack upon herself,’ or perhaps better, ‘as ⁵
implying hatred oflrer! '

92. tanti, i.e. as to abstain from 're-marriage.

93. maura, they are to put themselves in their father's place,
and actually to feel, as he feels‚ all that coming age brings with it.

lam nuno, as usual, anticipatory of the future: ‘begin at
once to.'

94. ad, ‘to meet:’ neo vacet ulla via, ‘let no path be nn·
trod,' or ‘unguarded’ or, as we might say, ‘let no stone be un-

longer. Rather she prays that her young children may have the tact
and steadiness of a greater age given them, that they may be a com-
fort to their father. ‘May the age that I have lost be added to
you: so may offspring of mine bring joy to Paullus¹ old age‚' i. e.
because of the comfort they would be to him. That they should
survive their father was only natural, and needed no special prayer.

97, 98. ‘I die happy: I never lost a child: not one of you is
absent from my funeral!

99. causa perorata eat. Almost a technical form for the '
ending of a speech.

100. humus, apparently ‘the underworld,’ and especially the
judges before whom she hasbeen pleading. Propertius is fond of
using such words as huntus, cinis. rogus, etc, to denote any of the
consequences of, or conditions subseqnent to, death.

101, 102. I. e. some have been raised to heaven by their virtues: l
she will be satished if she be deemed worthy of an honourable burial.
