addaiu& . , . oum. Instead of repeating qnod aster qnantum, he

uses a new expression, in agreement with the generad sense of the
passage: ¹ as that (1 love her) when,' etc.
21. oum is probably the preposition, and the construction is
Committit scripta sua cnm (scm'ptis) Corinnae,
Exactly parallel is a. 8. a 3
Et cua cum murrae permiscuit ossa praellae,
where miserae patellae is the reading oi N. (Tyrrell, Hermathena, vol.
a, corr. misera puella).
’ The only objection to this natural construction is that Propertius
usually uses the Greek form of genitive and accusative iu Greek names
oi the first declension, such as Antigones, Persephorus, Helenen,
etc. But there are exceptions, as Helenae 3. 8. 32, Hermionae 1. 4. 6,
Antiopae 1, 4. 5, Ariadna sup, 18, and probably Achilli 4.11. 39,
which are enough to break the rule (see Hertz. Qu. P. 164).

Ii Corinnae be the dative, crem must be the conjunction, aud the
name must go directly witlr committit, as in Juvenal 6. 378, the
poetess being identified with her poems, so thatCorinnae will be
equivalent to seraptis Corinnes. Committere, ‘to join,’ or ‘match'
is used with an accusative, either oi the engagement, as in the phrase
committere praelium, ‘to join battle‚' or ot the combatants engaged.
So Juvenal 1. 162

licet Aernam Rutulumque ferocem
Committas,

and 6. 436, where the literary protensious oi the ‘blue stoclring' are
well hit off, Committit vates et comparat, Cp. Mart. 7. 24. 1. Ι

22. quae quaevis, So Palmer, interpreting the words oi
Corinna's pride in her own poems: ‘who deems no poems, whatever
they be, equal to her own’ But corrnina refers more naturally to
scripto, Cynthia's own verses: and the emphasis requires that the
couplet should close with a strong statement oi Cynthia‘s excellence,
not of Corinna’s. N. hasquae q‘uioir. Gronhasquae lymes,t'rom
which Beroaldus conj. carminaque Erimus, which is very plausible.
Corinna was a poetess oi Tanagra in Boeotia, who fiourished
in the fifth century, iae. Erinna was a lesbian poetess, co·
temporary with Sappho. Quae quiuis might possibly .mean
⁶ ‘poems which any author, however famous, cannot deem equal to
his own,’ i. e. only equale he must deem them superior. R. Ellis,
