' 326 Nonas

10. Note the unusual and rough elision of que at the end of
the first penthemimer of the pentameter verse.

11. From the extreme west he pauses to the extreme east of
the Roman world, the banks of the Phasis, in Colchis.

propellas, which should apply to· the vessel‚ is here used by a
Propertian inversion of the water through which the oars sweep, pos·
sibly with the idea that the water is itself put in motion by the stroke.

remige. The oarsman is regarded as a mere instrument: hence
the preposition is omitted. This use of the ablative is near akin to
the ablative absolute. See Mauro quoted by Mayor on Juv. 1. 13.

12. retineas trebie lter, i.e. the whole voyage performed by
the Argo, here called the ‘ Peliae ship,' because Jason‚ the rightfnl

heir, was despatched from Iolcus to fetch the golden fleece by his Ι

uncle Pelias. Α

13. rudis may either mean the ship ‘which was late an un·

shapen tmnk‚' like Cat. 4 10

Ubi ille post phaselus antea fuit

Comata silva;
or ‘inexperienced’ as going on her first voyage; so Propertius says
of himself 3, 21. 17

Ergo ego nunc rudis Hadriaci vehar aquaria ,hospa

This seems supported by 1, 14. Or it may denote the rough un-
shapen character of this first essay in ship-bnilding. Cp. 'rufis Argus
a. 26. 39, if rudis, not ratis, be read.

aaut. The same use of present for perfect that has been
noticed elsewhere in Propertius: see 2. y. 2, 3. 7. 2², 4- ¹· 77· 1²1,
and 4. a. 3, etc.

Argoa . . . columba. A similar use of the ablative to remige
l. 12. The seer Phineus advised the Argonauta to let loose a dove
before venturing through the Symplegades; the dove flew through
with the loss only of the tip of her tail. Following this example, '⁸
they sailed at full speed between the rocks, and escaped with a slight
injury to the stem, Apoll. Rhod. a. 562. Cp. a. 26. 39

Et qui ncovistis duo litora, cum ratis Argo
Duxerat ignoto missa columba mari.

15. A conupt line. N. reads Et si quo angae. Vossius cou-
jectures Onygii‚ which Lachmann changed into Ortygahe, referring
in either case to an old name Ortygia given to Ephesus, probably
from ὄρτυξ, because the coast abounded in quails. Scaliger has
Etsi quadram, understanding by quadn'ga the four cities of Ephesus,
Smyma‚ Colophon, and Miletus Swans abound in the Cayster,
Claud. Ep. 2.12: hence olonferi in Italian editions, and cygnaci.
