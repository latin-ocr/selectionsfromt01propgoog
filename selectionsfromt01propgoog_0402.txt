propensum, ιν. 3., 23-48. 335

My eyes slzull be but eyes te weep,
And neither eyes to see uor sleep.
88. dooti. ..positura dat is the disposition os the world
made by a wisc Creator. Cp. Virg. Aen. 12. 94
· ualidam vi corripit leastum,
Actoris Aurunci spolium,
of the spoil takeusrom Actor.

39. lenta, as Paley remarks, is used ol ‘ adhesive’ substanoes‚
such as honey, pitch, wax, ete„ while putris is ‘ loose,' ‘friable,’ osa
light soil, Virg. Geo. a. 204, opposed to a clay soil which lentescit .
habendo.

ab, ‘in consequence of!

42. peterat, ‘falsely declares?

43. mppolyte, Queen of the Amazons. Cp. 3. 14. 13

Qualis Amazonidum nudatis bellica mammis.

44. barbara. Note the emphatic position oi this word, in
eontrast to Romanis in the next line. As Pinder puts it, ⁴ Happy in
the freedom other wild state! ¹

45. See the very interesting debate iu the Senate, recorded by
Tacitus, Ann. 3. 3 3, 34, as to whether governors of provinces should
be allowed to take their wives with hem.

47. Pater. 1f the reading Africus in the next line be correct,
the n'tle Pater must be applied to the wind in the same way that it
is constantly applied to rivers. The only parallel given is Claud.
Rapt. Pros. 2. 73, where Zephyrus is addressed as Pater Ogra·
tissime veris. If for Africus we read· some word other than the
name of a wind, Pater will stand for Jupiter, asin Hor. Od. 3. 10. 7

Aude's . . . et positas ut glaciet uiues
Pure numine Iuppiter.

48. The MSS. have Africus: but Africus was pur excellence the
warm steamy wind of the Mediterranean, the South-west, the Greek
niwnhe sirocco of modern times,the last wind in the world to be asso·
ciated with frost. Hence the various conjectures given in the critical
notes But elsewhere Auster is called frigidus Prop. 2. 26. 36, and
Virg. Geo. 4. 261 ; turbidusHor. Od. 3. 3. 5 ; and Tib. 1.1.47has

Aut gelidas lu'beruus aquas cum suderat Auster.

Africus itself is often associated with storms: Africis procellis
Hor. Od. 3. 29. 57; praecipitent A. id. 1. 3. ιη proteruus A. id. ,
Epod. 16. 22. Either then Propertius uses Africus vaguely of a
wind that brings rough, coarse westher; or else implies that in
Scythia, whose cold the Romans greatly exaggerated, even Africus
congeals ever'ything with srost. None os the conjectures proposed
