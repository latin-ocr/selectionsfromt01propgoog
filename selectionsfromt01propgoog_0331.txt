NOTES.

Ο who shall le'gletly say etat senze
Is nothing bnt an empty name,
When but sor etat eur ngkty dead,
All ages pust, a blank wereld be,
Snnk in obliuion's rnnrky bed
A desert bare, u shinless sea.
26. Eaemonio viro, i. e. Achilles, from Haemonia, the old
name of Thessaly.
Ι 27. Postgate adopts G. Wolff’s conjecture Ievis cnm prole Sce-
mandre. on the ground that flumina shows that two rivers must be
intended, and that Propertius is referring to Hom. ll. 21. 2, where
the Scamander summons the Simois to help him against Achilles.
But this change, as Palmer says, is rescribere nen emendare Proper-
tium. Reading the whole passage 25-30 through, it will bc seen
that each line contains a single and separate idea, so that Postgate’s
argument that flumina, l. 26, ‘shows two rivers must be mentioned'

falls to the ground. Rather the mention of Achilles’ river-fight- ,

mainly with the Scamander—calls up the Simois as being famous on
another ground. Palmer ingenionsly conjectures

Idaeos mentes (or Idaeo snb munte) Ievis incunabula parvi,
quoting Virg. Aen. 3. 105, to show that Crete was looked upon as the
‘cradle' of Jove,
’ Mons Idaeus nbi et gentis cunabula metrae,
and Cic. Att. a. 41 to illustrate the connection os mentes with irnnna·
bule: Ad mentes patrios et ed incunabula nestra. R. Ellis, Journal
of Phil. 15. p. 18,¹ supports the MS. reading. He well quotes Manilius
a. 25 Iouis et cunabula ntagni, and Ovid's Iouis incunabulo Creten,
and points out that Pacatus Paneg. Theodos. 4has the very expression
of Propertius, terra Cretensis parui Ievis gloriata cunabulis. The
confusion between the Trojan and Cretan ida, and between other
similar names in Crete and the Troad, is frequent and well known.
See Herz.'s note.

28. per campos. Postgate adopts the conjecture ter for per, re·
garding it asa certain correction. So Palmer. But it is unnecessary, aud
does not improve the sense. To say that Hector ‘thrice through or
across the plain stained the chariot-wheels of Achilles’ is an intelli-
gible mode of saying that three turns or courses were made through
the plain, i. e. that he was thrice dragged round the city. But to
say that he ‘ thrice stained the plain, thrice the whecls' is less obvious
rn meanrng.

29. The termination oi this line is unsatisfactory. Polydamas
is quoted by cie, Pers, etc, as the Mrs. Grundy of the time, from
