PROPERTJUS, 111. 4., 19-223111. 5., za 283

explains stant as durant, nau facile din’muntur': ‘I am compelled
-to wage war, yet not from avariae, bnt from differences with Cynthia?
2. stant, of battles, means ‘are set,' ‘are ranged,' implying
instant conflict. See above, 3. 3. 44
Mariano praelia sigm Sient:
not dissimilar is stant littore puppes Virg. Aen. 6. 902, ‘are
ranged,' ‘drawn up.’ Ι
ι 3. inviae auro has much the same meaning as Virgil's auri
‘ sacraflames Aen. 7. 57, implying not so much ‘hated,' as ‘worthy of
being hated,’ ‘ hatesul’ The Augustan writers, especially Cicero, are
fond oi using the past participle passive in place of the adjective in
-bilia So Virg. Aen. 5. 591, of the labyrinth,
, . Fallunt indeprensus et z'rrenuabilis error.
4. gamma divim The allusion here is to drinking-cupa and
flagons hollowed out bi a single precious stone. Such extravagances

the former being cups made oi a single piece of amber.

Maecenas to the war,

Nau ut iuvencis illigata pluribus
Aratra m'tantur mea.

6. miser, so the MSS. N. also'has aere for aera, evidently
mistaking the construction. But Palmer is probably right in read·
ing misera, to agree with Corintke. The a at the end os misera
would easily get dropped besore the a of aera; and the sentiment of
miser, explained by Pinder to mean ‘Nor mean enough to get money
through thy fall: is indeed by no means a Roman sentiment, or one
possible in an Augustan writer. Even Juvenal, who magnificeutly
denounces rapacity iu the provinces, nowhere rises to the idea that
the governor is morally degraded by spoiling the provincials; his
highest sentiment is miserere inopum sociomm 8. 89. If miser be
read, the meaning probably is, ‘Nor have 1, poor wretchl the luek
