308 NOTES.

e. g. stringere semum, usually wrongly translated ‘to draw.' Stn’cto
gladie is ‘sword in hand? How it came to signify ‘just to touch
' annno more' is not clear: perhaps from the idea of pressing or
touching without penetrating. Thus Virg. Aen. 5. 163
Litus ama, et laevas ste-fugat siue palmula cautes ,·
and in Ov. Am. 3. 2. Ia, of chariots just grazing the meta,
⁸ Nunc siringam metas interiore rota.

ab, not exactly redundant: it states the causation in a more
emphatic way. or denotes the effect as immediate. Excidet ab
aevo, 3. a. 25, quoted by Palmer, is different; putris ab aestu, 4.
3. 39, is ¹ in consequence of the heat' It is hard however to give
ab any special meaning in a. η. 11

Solus amans navit quaetdo periturus, et a qua
Morte.

25. In allusion, apparently, to the great dykes attributed to
’ Semiramis by Herod. 1. 184, by which he says the Euphrates, which
formerly inundated the whole plain, was kept within its banks.
Duxit is here used for the making of a new chemel, and so ‘leading
off’ or ‘divertiug' the waters: cp. aquaeductus. Propertius' idea
seems to be that she introduced the water into the city.

26. surgere. Propertius evidently makes a confusion between
thetaking of Bactra, which Semiramis accomplished, andthe founding
‘¹ of her capital. Bactra, the capital of Bactriana, was known to the
Romans as forming the most distant part of the Parthian empire:
hence they use the name vaguely as synonymous with the extreme
East. So Hor. Od. 3. ²9· 28,Vi1·g.Geo. 2158, Aen. 8. 688. Iu all
¹ three passages the city Bactra is used instead of Bactriana, evi·
dently in ignorance. To a Roman mind the Euphrates would at
once suggest the Parthians. There is thus no need to change sur-
ger'e, with Burmann and Lachmann, into subdere.

27. Rapere tn ius is a common expression: tn erimine will
mean therefore ‘ in advancing my impeachment.’

nan, as frequently, gives the reason not for a statement made,
bnt the reason why the writer makes (or, as here, omits to make) a
statement. ‘I pass on from Semiramis-for what need to instance
¹ heroes aud gods when we have the example of Jupiter himself f-
and tell of our latest and greatest scandal' See Hertzberg's refer-

* , erices, especially Stat. Silv. 2. 1. 210

. obeunt noctesque diesque

' ¹ Astraque, uec solidis prodest sua machina terris;
Nam papulas, mortale genus, plebisque caducae
Quis fleat interitus?
