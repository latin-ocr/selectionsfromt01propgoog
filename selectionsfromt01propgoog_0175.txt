is connected with calo (καλέω), whence come calendae, concilium,

people, called together especially sor war purposes. Hence it
originally meant ‘an army? a use which evidently puzzled Livy,
for he tells us 4. 34. 6 Classi quoque ad Fidenas pugnaturn

atque incredibilem. The word is used in the same sense by Virg.
Aen. 7. 716
Ι Hortinae classes populique Latini.
When Servius divided the people into divisions according to their
wealth, each of the five divisions into which tbe wealthier citizens
(i. e. those possessing as much as 12,5oo asses) were divided was
called a ‘classis3’ while those who belonged to the first, i. e.
wealthiest, class, were emphatically called classici. From this
meaning sprang the phrases ‘classical 'authors' and ‘the classica·
as we learn from a passage in Geli. 19. 8. 15 classicus assiduusque
aliquis scriptor, non proletarius, the term proletarius denoting
those who were too poor to be enrolled in any ol the classes

relative sense, lor Hor. Ep. 1. 4. 7 addresses the poet
Di tibi divitias dederunt oneraque fruendi.
The word mea of itself qualifies the paupertas: ‘such poverty as is
mine ;' a poverty which, as he goes on to explain, enabled him to
live in idleness. From the allusions in ll. 19, 20 it would appear
that Tibullus’ property was not so valuable as it had been. It is
generally assumed that it must have been in part confiscated during
the confiscations ol Β. c. 42. But confiscations were seldom ii ever
partial: and Tibullus' own words point rather to his property
having fallen in value than to its loss. More probably, therefore, he
was only a sufferet from ‘the agricultural depression' which iol·
lowed the civil wars.
