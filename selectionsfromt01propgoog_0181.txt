upon this point are very contradictory. Varro, however, distinctly
asserts that the number and names os Penates were indeterminate.
‘As there were Phblie as wellas Domestic Lares, so there were ,
Public Penates who exercised a general iuflueuce over the destinies
of the whole Roman people. Thus Tacitus tells ue, Ann. 15. 41,
that delubrum Vestae cum Penatibus Populi Romani was cousumed
along with other very ancient temples in the great fire during the
reign ol Nero. Apparently the temple os Vesta, being the common
hearth or central point of the city, was the proper abode os the Public
Penates. Dionysius also, R. A. 1. 68, describes a temple iu the
Velia (that part os the Forum immediately under the Palatine) in
which were “images os the Trojan Penates, two young meu in a
sitting posture, with spears in their hands, awork oi ancient art;’'
and. adds that he had seen many other effigies of these gods in
ancient shrines, always represented as two young men in martial
equipment. These we should naturally suppose to be the Trojan or
Phrygian Penates mentioued so osten in the Aeneid, supposed to
have been rescued from the flames ol Troy by Aeneas, and trans·
ported by him to Italy?
