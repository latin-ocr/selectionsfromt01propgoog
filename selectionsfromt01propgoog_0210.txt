his murder by Typhon (Set). This myth probably typifies the
struggle of darkness with light, and also of good* with evil. In the
same manner the departed human soul was held to follow the Snn in
his course through the nether world and to rise again. One special
function of Osiris is that of Judge of the Dead: a functiou appa-
rently assigned to no other deity. He frequently appears in this
capacity' 1n representations of Hades; heis swathed as a mummy,
and beside bimis his minister Anubis, with the face of a dog or
jackal, who assists in laying ont the dead, etc.

Isis again alfords an instance of the sels-dividing process of the
one original power in the matter of sex, as into active and passive. Just
as several male gods may be fused into one, so Isis becomes Athor‚
Neith, Bast, etc. And the male power himself, becoming ἀρσενό·
opius, is styled both ‘father of fathers’ and also ‘mother of mothers,’
the strouger sex absorbing the properties of both. Osiris, too, as
primal spirit, being identified with primal matter, becomes the water
which is the womb of the world, and hence passes on to be the Nile
or even the Ocean. It is obvious that this quasi-Hegelian process

may account to some extent for the different accounts given by Greek '
Ι authors ol Osiris and other Egyptian deities.

The river Nile was worshipped both in his own right, and also
as representing Osiris. Hymns addressed to the Nile have been found:
and Brugsch gives au inscription from a sarcophagus, on which the
four gods, representing the four elements, who bestowed favonrs ou
the departed, are thus enumerated: ’

Ra, lte gives thee lz'glet.

ἔτι, Ire gives thee sweet breatlr of air.

ch (or Seb, the Earth), Ιιι gives thee all growing sme'ts.

Osinssr, Ιιι gives thee tlte Nile, thou livest again.

The two aspects of the Nile—the earthly and the heavenly—give
a further illustratiou of the transforming tendency ol Egyptian
mythology. For as the earthly Nile is often named Nun or Oceanus,
in one inscription heis styled ‘Occasu-Nile (Nun-Hirpi), Father of
Deities.’ So too the heavenly stream assumes sometimes the name
Hap or Hapi, which was the Egyptian title for the eartbly river ¹.
