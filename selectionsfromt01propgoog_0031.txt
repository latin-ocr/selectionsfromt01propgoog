xxiv INTRODUCTJON

os uneventful seclusion on the remains of his estate at
Pedum, unconscious, it would seem, of the great revolu-
tion taking plaee around him, and without making any
effort-beyond cultivating the friendship of Horace-
to make his way into that brilliant literary circle which
was repaying the patronage os the new government
