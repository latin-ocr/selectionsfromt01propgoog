206 NOTES.

11. 37 Metuebant eum serui, verebantur liberi, and Phil. 12. 12. 29
Quid? Veteranos non veremur? num timeri se ne ejici quidem
volunt. The same contrast is brought out in Ad Quint. r. 1, and

le· {9151}th Just as Virgil’s nec dona moror, Aen. 5. 400,

‚ means ‘ I do not stop the gifts,’ ‘I let them go past me,' and so ‘I

do not care for them3’ so here meror fata means, ‘I would do
nothing to avert,’ aad so ‘am indifferent to'

· extremo, an ornamental, intensifying epithet. It is not used to
part off one kind of rogus from another—as in such common phrases·
as extremo tempore, eto—but to indicate a quality which is uni-
versal: ‘the pile which is life’s end! The word is used in exactly
the same way in 1.17. ²3

Illa meum extremo clamasset pulvere nomen,
and in 3. a. 18 (20) ’
Mutis ab extrema conditione vacant.
debita fata rogo. Nothing can be more crude and unpoetical

‚ than to say', with Kinnoel and Pinder, that fata ‘stands for “a

dead body '' ;’ or, with Paley, that it is a periphrasis sor fatum
rogi, whatever thatmight mean. Surely neither poetry nor sense
requires anything to ‘stand for' so fine a phrase as ‘Nor would
1 stay thefate that is my funeral pyre’s due?

3. na goes with Hic timor est, the emphatic Hic being ex-
planatory of the sentence ne careat: ‘But I have a sear—a fear
more stern than death itself—that thy love may be absent from my
burial.' =
5. 1³uar is of course Cupid. It is possible, as Hertzberg
suggests, that there may have been running through the poet's mind
a conoeit which he illustrates from two passages from the Greek
Anthology, according to which the eyes of Aphroditear'e re·
presented as anointed with bird-lime to enable her to catch her
prey. This is bad enough; but when Paley translates this into
‘The lover goes about with his eyes smeared to catch Cupid as he
flies, and so is unable to shalre him off again,’ the idea becomes
intolerable. The eyes are the seat of Love; it is through the eyes
that Love iscaught up and answered. Olivia in Twelfth Night says,

Methinks I feel this youth's peefectiens,
With an invisible and subtle stealtlr,
To creep in at mine eyes.
It was by the eyes that Cynthia first captured Propertius, 1. 1. 1
Cynthia prima suis misenam me cepit ocellis.

The figure therefore of Cupid having settled on the poet’s eyes, and
