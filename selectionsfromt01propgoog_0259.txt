192 NOTES.

Here taeda stands for ‘marriage' as in Virg. Aen. 4. 18, where Dido
sas
y, Si mu pertaesum thalami taedaeque fuisset.

Iam. Postgate seems to miss the force of this word: ‘the
argument is, “to pass on to me,I shall always be true to you.’''
Surely uam gives the reason fo the sudden change of tone intro-
duced by sed in l. 17, ⁴ Nay, after all. Ι must pray for thy happy
voyage: for Ι can never give up my love sor thee, and wherever
thou goest, thou shal't yet be mine!

21. eorrumpere. It should be noticed that this word does not
exactly correspond to our word ‘to corrupt) It means ‘to break
through,’‘ to break utterly‚' ‘to destroy,’ and so to render a thing use·
less forits proper object. To a people who worshipped strength above
all things, a word signilying loss of strength came naturally to have
a moral meaning ; but the ideas associated with it were rather ‘those
of loss of fibre, weakness, and luxury, which the Roman moralists
especially connected with loss os manly virtue, than what we denote
by moral corruption. Thus Sallust, Jng. 39. 5 milites . . . licentia
atque lascivia corruperam Tac. Hist. 3. 49 disciplinam carrum·
pere; Virg. Geo. 2. 466 '

Nec casia liquidi corrumpitur uetes aaut,

ie. ‘deteriorated’ ‘spoiled’ and Hor. Sat. 1. 5. 95 of a road,

utpote longum
carpentes iter et factum corruptius imbri,

i. e. ‘broken np.’ In the passage before ns the word may mean that
no second love, no marriage, shall ⁴ break down' or ‘weaken’ the
love he bears to Cynthia.

22. quta is only used, as Postgate points out, after negative or
qnasi-negative sentences (such as questions), and introduces the thing
which one is not prevented from doing. Its meaning is equivalent
to ‘so as notz’ as here, ‘No marriage shall change me sa that 1
shall uot complain’ Its most usual use is after verbs of doubting:
uon dubium est quin eam auderint means literally, ‘No doubt
exists so that I did not see her ’ =‘ N ο doubt exista which interferes
with, or preventa, my having seen her,' i. e. ‘There is rro doubt but
that I saw her,’ or ‘asto my having seen her.¹ &ominus has pre·
cisely the same sense alter verbs of preventing or hindering.

verba querar. As Postgate points out, there is no need to alter
this reading. Verba is the cognate accusative after querar, which
is used in the sense oi ⁴ to pour forth by way of complaint’ Thns
Verba queri is ‘to pour sorth complaining words’ or ‘words oi
