to the and in utera, and theu back to the 3rd in acczpiat, this reading
is the best yet proposed.

praeventa, used of riding or gliding past, as in Tac. Ann. a. 6
of the Rhone, servat noman qua Germaniam praeuehitur. H. A.
J. Munro (Journal os Phil. 6. p. 49), besides objecting to the asyn-
deton oi the MS. reading, and to the omission oi ta l. ao, holds
that it is impossible to use the past part. praevecta in the sense
ol the present part, showing that Lachmann’s instances ospraeter-
” vehar are all in the present tense, and comparing Livy‘s praetervehens
aqua with Cicero's use oi praetervecta in the pass. (pro Cael.51). He
therefore repeats the conj. Ut te praevertam felice Ceraunia ramo,
pointing ont that selice occurs in Cicero, and infelice in Catullus.
But praevecta. as practically equivalent to a pres. part, may be
illustrated by provectas-1. 143 and if we read utare, the objection
to praevecta is practically removed. The rowing would not be
prononnced felix nuyil the dangers were passed.

ceraunia, referring to the precipitous cliff and acute promon-
tory called Acroceraunia, which forms the termination of the
Ceraunian Mountains. This promontory was just to the north of
Oricum (or Oricos), and was the main terror oi the passage lrom
Italy to Greece. Bold indeed must have been the man, says Hor.
Od. r. 3. 19, who first dated to sace the sea:

Qui uidit mare turgidum et
infames scapulos Acroceraunia.

20. Orico· or orionus, a town on the confines of Illyria and
Epirus, at which passengers bound for Rome would wait for favour·
able weather. Thus Asteria’s lover Gyges is detained at Oricum,

Hor. Od. 3. 7. 5
Ille Notis actus ad Oricum

Post insana Caprae sidera.

Oricum and Dyrrhachium (further north on the same coast) were
the Calais and Boulogne, as Brundusium was the Doter or
Folkestone, of the Roman world.

21. lton uuae man. The torch was so essential a part of
the marriage procession, as it was also of the iunmal procession,
. that the word taeda by itself may stand for either ceremony. Thus
in Prop. 4. 11. 46 the shade of Cornelia describes her whole wedded
life by the words

Viximus insigms inter utramque facem,
and Ov. Her. aa. 172
Et sace pro thalami fax milri martis erit.
