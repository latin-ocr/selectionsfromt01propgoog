' Pliny and Mela had vague ideas ol an eous weanus or eoum more,
which they held to bound India on the East, and proposes ane
aquae, translating‘ And the lndran of theEas tem wave bumt toa dis-
coloured hue Bur if the Indian could be described as ‘of the East
ern wave he might equally well be said to live orbe‘ on theEastern
wave, ’and to most persons the latter will seem the more natural ex-
pression. Indusrsno doubt as the whole passage shows the Indran
not‘ the river Indus! As applied to the' river Indus, discolor would
give a good sense, as it is a fact that the colonr of' its waters presents
a strong contrast to that of the bine sea att rt s mouth. ll discolor be
applied to the Indian, it can only mean ‘oi a colour different from
ns,' or ‘from the rest olmankind? Cp. Virg Aen. 6. ²04

Discolor unde ouri per ramos auro refulszt,
where dsscolor means ‘of a colour different irom that of the objects
around it!

loa.. .,aqua on the above view, must be an ablative of place,

‘on the shores ol the Eastem waters.' Cp. 1. 14. 1

Tu licet abz'cctus Tiberina molliter undo ;
and a. 13. 55 (if wc follow the MSS.)

Illic formosum acuisse paludibus. ¹
A simplet interpretation, however, ol this passage may be suggested.
Every one knows the effect ol a strong sun reflected lrom the sea in
sun-buming the skin: why should not Propertius mean quite naturally
‘The Indian bumt to a discolonred hue by the Eastern wavel’
The Romans only knew oi the Indian coast3 they knew ol the sea
that washed it as being ever under a broiling tropical· sun, and may
well have attributed to this cause, at least in part, the swarthy com·
plexion ol the Indians. Cp. especially 3. 13. 15, 16.

11. marita, here used as a participle=‘ thy wedded troth,’ as
ιιι 4.11. 33 facibus mritis ,¹ in Ov. Her. 4 134sratrc marita soror,
and perhapsin Hor. Od. 3. 5. 6

Milesnc Crassi coniuge barbara

st pactas Paley much improves the point of this line hy
reading et sic pactae milri noctes, etc. ‘Was it on these terms that
I gave mysels up to theel’

12. rudis, ‘all inexperienced,' ‘a novice!

ueta, nominative feminine singular.

The ordinary phrase for ‘ yielding ' is darc manses, as 4. 11. 88. ’

13. deduotae, of the marriage procession which escorted the
bride to her new home. An exactly similar processioa may be seen
in some Scottish villages to this day-as in Leadhills in Lanarkshire
