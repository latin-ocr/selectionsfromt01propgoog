TO T IBULLUS. xxi

to reside upon it: and though he speaks olten 01 his
poverty, it is always 01 a poverty which is not inconsistent

with competency. Thus in 1.1.19-22 he compares his
present with his former condition:

Vos quaque felicis quandam nunc pauperis agri
Custodes, fertis munera vestra, Lares:

Tunc vitula innumeros leutrabat caesa iuvencas,
Nunc agrae em'gur' est hestia parva sali.

‘Ye, too, my Lares, guardians 01 an estate once rich,
now poor, receive your gifts3 in those days would a calf
be slaughtered to purify unnumbered steers‚ but now for ’
my tiny farm there falls a little lamb!

And when, at the end 01 the same poem, he resignsto the
avaricious the hope 01 bringing back a fortune from the
wars, he adds on his own account:

Ego coraposito securus acervo
Despiciam dites despiciamque famem.

‘With pile stored up, Ι shall know no care: l shall envy
not the rich, Ι shall sear not hunger?

Thus his property is reduced, not lost altogether: and
his tone throughout his poems is that 01 a man who pos-
sesses a modest competence‚ and whose aim in life it is to y
make the most of the simple pleasures which it could
afford him. But the standard 01 wealth at Rome was
high in the days 01 Tibullus; and that he was still very
comfortably off, in spite 01 his losses, is plain from the
words 01 Horace, Ep. 1. 4. 7, who says to him

. Di tibi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi ;

‘The gods have given thee wealth, with the knowledge
how to enjoy it.' .
While again in 1. 10 he says that he has

Et mundus victus non deficiente crumena,

‘A tidy competence‚ and a purse that fails not.’
