,296 · NOTES.

29. Intense feeling is shown by the abnrpt way in which the
poet addresses one aiter another the persons or things which have
contributed to the death of Paetus, without taking time to realise
what they are. Cp. 1. 253 here the builders of ships are apostrophised.

N. has curvae, mistaking rates ior a vocative. Curvate is the

elever but umsecessary conjecture oi Mr. Peskett and Mr. G. T. Ien- .

drum. It is much more forcible to identify the curvas rates with
the causas leti. The following line is the commentary.

30. aeta, ‘of impelling ships. Propertius means that those
who go to sea are rowers in Death’s vessel' Postgate. This surely
is to introduce unnecessarily a foreign idea. The words merely
imply that those who make ships make occasions sor death: a
death like that of Paetus is brought on, caused, by human hands;
nota, apparently in the widest sense, after the analogy of agere
vitam, agere otia, agere opus (3. 5. 8), etc. The harshness of the

phrase is mitigated by the fact that the death was a violent one- '

‘brought on,' almost ‘inflicted,‘ by the hand ol man. .

31. marat. Looking back to the time when this new chanuel
for death had been devised. Α

satta of a natural death, like Fortunae vias in the next line.
Fortunae miseras vias is generally taken, as by Pinder, ‘Chance ways
that lead to misery.' But in fact fortunae vias is exactly=montis
item· miseras is an ‘epitheton omans? ,‘The hapless ways ol
Fortune' is equivalent to ‘the many sad forms or modes of death!
See notes on mortis iter sup. l. a, and animi via 3. 5. 10.

33. For teneat, tenuere, cp. a. 10. 14. Propertius was pro-
bably not conscious that he was using the word in slightly different
senses. He uses common words like tenere, agere, via, with great
width of meaning. -

34. santerre.. Pindertranslates,‘Earth,man’sproperelement,’
as though the language was that ol a hen seeing her duckling brood
take to the water. Sua terra is obviously to be explained by
Penates, l. 33. oi his native country. Postgate quotes Ov. Am. a. 11.
30, which is exactly in point. Ι

35. ruas. See note on 3. 5. 6. The word is here used os
ship-building, :fiscia aedificas.

36. consenuit, the aoristic perfect, to denote frequency or
habit. Postgate well quotes Cat. 4. 25 nunc recondita Semt quiete.

ratur . . ‚fldem ‘breaks its word,’ the opposite olfidem servare
or praestare. The idea is the same as thatin a. 25- 24

Cum saepe in pontu fracta carina natet.
37. maurane. So N. Many edd. have adopted imulr'as on
