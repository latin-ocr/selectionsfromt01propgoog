PROPERJTIUS, I.,14., 7-19. 199

OClzlorr's, tlzou dost imitate thysolf, = . · ·
Self-imitating parsctlr precious rioms ,·,
For all the Eastern-Indian golden pels,
Thy red and white with truestfaz'r atones.
IIow far removed is the elaborate ⁴ conceit’ oi the modern poet
from the simplicity and directness of Propertius!

1314. There rs much m thrs poem as wellasmpoems8 17,
and 18, which remiud us of passages in Shalrespeare’s Sonnets.
Cp. Sonnets a 5 and 29, which ends with the lines
For thy sweet love ‘rentembered such wealtlr bmstngs
T dat then I s'com to change my state wath tinga
Cp. lines 23, ²4· But every comparison only brings out more clearly .
the essential differences between the ancient and modern conceptions'
os love. How unintelligible to Propertius would have been the
spirit oi Scott’s well-known lines, though they reproduce the main
idea oi ll. 17-24: .
In peace love tunes the shepherds recd,
In war he mounts the warrior's steed,
In halle, in gay attire is seen,
In lambis, dames on the green.
Love rules the court, tlte camp, tlte grove,
For love is lienum, and Heaven is love.

tristi, of a maiden who will not smile on her lover: so Prop.

Si quando suerit tristior illa tibi.

17-22. ‘Not strength or stemness, not wealth or luxury, can
keep Love away.’

18. dolor. The nominative, as elsewhere in Propertius, is here
