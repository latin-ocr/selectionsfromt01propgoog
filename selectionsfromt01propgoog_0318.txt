proruamus 11. 28, 13-35. Ι251

2¹1. Semele, daughter of Cadmus, being loved of Zeus, re·
quested that he would visit her in all his splendour: he appeared as
the god of thunder, and she was consumed.

There is no need to change sit into sis, for which, as Hertz.
points ont, fum's would be required. formosa stands for the class
of the beautiful: ‘at what peril a fair maiden lives,’ ‘what are the
perils of the fair?

periclo is an ablative of attendant circumstance, analogons or
equivalent to the ablative of price.

29. Maeonias, ‘Lydianz’ either for ‘Eastern’ in general, or
specially ‘Homeric,’ as not unfreqnently in Ovid. Thus we have
Maeonium carmen E. Ρ. 3. 3. 51, Maeoniae chartae id. 4.1a. 27, etc.

The young student will observe that omnis here is the accusa-
tive plural, which was frequently written with is for cs in the case of
i nouus. So in l. 56. .

32. durna dien, i. e. ‘the day of death,’ called niger ille dics

83. Schultze supposes this line to be addressed to Jupiter, the
dem of l. 5²· ‘Spare Cynthia, Jupiter: Juuo herself will permit this,
without feeling a wife’s jealousy.' But this is far-setched, and the

out; 'even fate may relent: even Juno with all her jealousy as a
wife will forgive thee in this,' lit. ⁴ will pardon this to thee,’ i. e. will
permit her to live, instead of nnrelentingly pursuing her, as in the
cases given above. The poet throughout assumes that it is the fatal
gift of beauty that is the cause os Cynthia’s illness.

coniunx may carry with it the additional idea that Juno is the
goddess of marriage and married women, and that her compassion
might specially be‘appealed to on a wife's behalf.

34. mugitum i. e. animo: ‘is touched,' ‘grieved’ Cp. our
‘beart-broken!

35. Atthis point a new poem commences in N.‚ whilst Jacob and
Lachmann make a third separate poem of ll. 47-62. But in reality
these points only mark subdivisions in the sense 0f an essentially
connected whole. See the argument as given in the English head·
iuga. The first part, ll. 1-34, is addressed to Cynthia: he declares
the cause of her malady, comforts her by mythological examples,
and bida her, even yet, have hope. In the second part, ll. 35-46,
his panio becomes acute: he has all but lost hope, magio rites
have failed, he makes one last despairing appeal for her recovery.
The concluding portion is a paean of joy over her safety: she has
been spared by Persephone, who indeed, he thinks, might well spare
