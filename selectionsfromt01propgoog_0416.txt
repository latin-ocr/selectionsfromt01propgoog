a long sharp point projecting lrom the south or Acarnanian shore ;
between this point and the promontory which comesto meet it
from the shore oi Epirus on the north, the channel at one point is
no more than 700 yards in width. On a height close to the pro·
montory of Actium stood an ancient temple of Apollo Actius or
Actiacas. Near this spot was the camp ol Antony; his lieet lay in
the spacious hay within (now the Bay oi Prevesa), and hewas
strong enough to occupy the straight itself, on either side of which
he had thrown up redoubts. Augustus was euccmped on the north ·
or Epirote shore, ou the spot where he afterwards founded the town
oi Nicopolis in honour ol his victory: his iicet lay at Comerus, a
point ol the coast ot' Epirus outside the channei. He was unable to
force the eunance: and the great battle was brought on outside the ,
straight, when Antony, dispirited by iailures and desertione, had
made up his mind to escape with his ticet to the East.
