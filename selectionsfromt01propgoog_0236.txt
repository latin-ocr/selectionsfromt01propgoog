TIBULLUS, 11. 5., 27-53. 169

dition pointed to Alba longa as the cradle of the race: thus the
Trojans had to be brought to Alba. But how was Alba to be reached
by a small colony arriving by sea? They sail up the Tiber, land
near its mouth, on the territory of Latinus, king of Laurentum. Their
first encampment is called Laurentia castra Aen. 10. 635. The
war over, Aeneas marries Lavinia, and fonnds a new settlemeut,
which he calls after his wife Lavinium, well on the way to Alba.
Thirty years later his son Ascanius moves the remaining step, and
transfers the govemment to Alba. The motive of the whole story is
plain. The laurrcs still grows in profusion on the low sandytract
where Aeneas landed.

43, 44. Cp. Liv. r. n Secundum inde praelium Latinis,
Aeneas etiam ultimum operum mortalium fuit. Situs est, quemcun-
que eum dici ius sasque est, super Numicium flantem· Iouem Indi-
getem appellant. See Ov. Met. 14. 598. Topographers generally
identify a small stream called the Rio Tmo with the Numicium
and Pratica‚ which lies close to it, with Lavinium.

44. caelo miserit. Note the construction. It is not so much
that caelo stands for ad caelum, as that miserit has a trajective force:
‘handed over to,' ¹transferred! In the case of caelum, the idea of ·
motion towards, as if it were a terrestria] joumey, is put out of sight.
Thus Italiae rrea’serit would be impossible.

47. mihtlucent. Agood example of the Dat. Ethicus. ‘1
see the camp blazing.’ Here the camp of Turnus is bumt: an inci-
dent not given by Virgil.

49. Ante oculos, i. e. in prophecy: she sees the whole future
course of Roman history. ’

51. placitura. Cp. above, 3. 35. Here, of course, no inten-
tion is signified: ‘destined to find favour in the eyes of.'

52. deseruisse. The effect of the perfect here (with the
present-perfect sense) is to add vividness, as if the scene were being
enacted before her eyes: ‘thou hast left the Vestal hearth:

53. rarum, going closely with concubitus, has the force or an
adjective. The explanation is not so much that the phrase is a
Graeciam, = τὰς λάθρα συνουσίας, as Orelli puts it-a mode of
expression contrary to the genius of Latin, which has no article—
but rather it is an elliptical phrase, the adverb being taken with a
participle suggested naturally by the context. Thus iterum comul
stands for ftemm consul creatus; populum late regem Virg. Aen. 1.
21 suggests late reptantem omms circa populi Liv. is short for
circa habitantes. ,

lassatos, as if she could no longer wear the maiden's fillet.
