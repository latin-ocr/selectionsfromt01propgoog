322 nores

Nor can we help recalling the story in the Arabian Nights of the
king whb vainly shut up his son in a tower of brass to save him
from his predicted sate.

27. unsar alluding to Hom. 11. a. 673

Νιρεὺς bs κάλλιστος ἀνὴρ ὑπὸ Ἴλιον ἢλθεν.
Cp. Ov. E. P. 4. 13. 15
Tam mala Thersiten prohibebat fierma latere,
Quam pulchra Nireus conspiciendus erat.

29. hio luctus, i. e. distress arising from this same Death, i. e.
Death itself.

30. Atridae, the dative, not the genitive. See the passages
quoted above, l. 15.

alter amor,hissecondlove. His wifeclytemnestra, was his first.

31. Ii the MS. reading traicis is right, then Bae. is probably
right in supposing that some lines have dropped out here. Paley's
conjecture traicit, adopted by Palmer, gives good sense, though the
emphasis of the line makes it hard to believe that tibi and nauta
refer to different persons. Traice't will bear its transitive meaning,
⁴ who causes to pass over’ or ‘seruies across?

32. ammae eorpus inane tuae may be either ‘ the body
empty of thy spirit‚’ as Ov. Met. 2. 611

Corpus e’nane animae fragres letale secuta est,
or, ‘the empty body of thy spirit,' i. e. ‘ consisting os thy spirit: as
“ though body and spirit were confused into one idea.

Pulmer reads hac, to correspond with qua l. 33: ‘by this same
road by which!

33. Siculae vietor, referring to the celebrated ancestor os
Marcellus, M. Claudius Marcellus, who conducted the great siege os
Syracuse in the second Punic War, rac. 212. Archimedes con-
ducted the desence oi the city, and was slain upon its capture.

Postgate observes that here, asin 5. 7. 55, Propertius supposes
there were two boats. This is s'omewhat inconsistent with publica
cymba l. 24, and is not absolutely necessary, as we may imagine
Charon landing part of his freight at one point, part at another.

34. ab humana via. These words are difficult. They seem
to support the reading leae l. 32 and the MS. reading tuae. ‘May
Charon carry thy spirit along that path by which Claudius and
Caesar rose to the stars from the path of men! We have already
n'oted the vague way in which Propertius uses the word via: see 1. a.
12, 2. 2 5. 46, Postgate well translates ‘ the ways’ or ‘haunts of men :⁸
probably Propertius was scarcely conscious that he was using the
word in a double sense.
