Movit Aiacem Telamone natum ·
Forma captivae dominum Tecmessae.

8. natat. The verb notare, though applied to the natural
swimming of men, fish, or other animals, is scarcely ever used of the
natural floatiug of ships. It constautly denotes wreckage of some
sort, as 4. 1. 116

Et notat exuviis Graecia presso suis.
. So Ithacam lugere notantem Juv. 10. 257 aud Prop. 3. 12. 3²
, Totque boemis noctes totque notasse dies.
in both of which passages the idea is that Ulysses was floundering
about, with nothing but his swimming powers to trust to. Eveu of
a ship in harbour the word denotes a wreck in Prop. 2. 2 5. 24
Cum saepe in pontefracto canoa natet.

Metaphorically, the word is always used o'n neolmn partem ,’ as of
inundatione, of eyes swimming in death or drunkennesa of a waveriug
mind, Hor. Sat. 2. 7. 6, of an ill-fitting shoe Ov. A. A. r. 516, where
it is joined with vagus, a word of kindred meaning. To the Roman
mind, whatever departed from the steady‚ the solid, the strong, the
straight, was bad.

A 9. iusta debita, the offices due to the dead, especially that of
sprinkliug earth over the corpse, Hor. Od. 1. 28. 24.

terrae here is ‘the body,’ properly ‘the remains when buried

in earth‚' as in 2. 13. 42
Non nihil od verum conscio terro sopit.

The epithet piae is transferred to the remains, as all the offices to
the dead have the character of pietas. Postgate's reference to po‘en-
tissimus on an inscription is scarcely in point. To take terrae with
Paley as a genitive is possible, but inelegant: besides, it is obviously
to be supplied as the object to humare in the next line.

10. pote stands for potis feminine, agreeing with mater. Poto’s
aud pote are used of all genders, and with both numbers, indifferently.

‚ cp. 2. 1. 46

Qua pote quisque, in eo conterat arte diens.

12. In illustration of this magnificent line—one of the finest in
all ancient poetry-Postgate quotes an epigram from Glaucus (Gk.
Anth. 7. 235), in which it is said, as here, of a drowned man, πᾶσα
θάλασσα τάφος. These words, he suggests, may be au echo of the
famous words of Pericles, Thuc. 2. 43, ἀνδρῶν γὰρ ἐπιφανῶν πᾶσα ti
τάφος. But no two phrases, similar aa they are iu meaning, could be
more utterly different iu sentiment. Pericles meant ‘Every land is a
monument to our mighty dead’ Propertius means ‘His mother has
no spot to look to as holding the retnains of her dear lost oue but
