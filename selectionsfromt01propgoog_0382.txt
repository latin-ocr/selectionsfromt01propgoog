PROPERTJUS, 111. 11, 713 111.18., 1-2. 315

must bi taken with stagna l. 2, as in Cat. 64. 66, where of Arindne’s

clothes, etc,
Omnia quae tota delapsa e corpore passim

. Ipsius aute pedes fluctus salis alludebant. ι

Elsewhere the word is used intransitively, or withacognate accusative,
asin Virg. Aen. 7. 117 Nec plura alludens. Ludere, with the accu-
sative, is only used inthe sense ‘to mock,' ‘to befook’

ab umbrouo may mean either ‘on the side of,’ ‘coming from,’
or ‘away from,' i. e. ‘ shut off from.¹ Postgate supporta the latter
interpretation by insula ea sinum ab alto claudit Liv. 30. ²4· 9,
which is different, as the island is said quite naturally to ‘shut off’ a
hay from the open sea. Strictly parallel is Virg. Aen. 1. 160

· insula portum ¹

Efficit obiectu laterum, quibus ansuis ab alto

Frangitur inque sinus scindit sese unda reductas.
Here the water itself frangitur ad alto, which seems to mean ‘is
broken as it rolls in lrom the sea' The Julian Harbour was the great
work of Agrippa, constructed in Β. c, 37 with a view to carrying on
the naval war with Sextus Pompeius, whose fleet had its head-quartem
opposite in Sicily. The dark and mysterious Lacus Asamus-the
haunt ol the Cumaean Sibyl—was separated hya mile oi land from
the Lucm'nus Lacus-famous for oysters-and this again was partly
protected from the outer sea by a narrow reei os rock called uia Her-
culis, because laid down by Hercules to spare himself the trouble of
going round the hay. Agrippa dug a canal between the two lakes,
and strengthened the nia Herculis into an efficient breakwater, leav-
ing a passage ior ships to enter.

pontu· is the outer sea, which now alludit, ie. washes up
through the continuous channel to the quiet waters of the lake within.
Virg. Geo. 2. 161, thus alludes to this great work:

Au memorem portus, Lucrinoque addita claustra,
Atque indigentum magnis stridoribus aequrr,
Iulia qua panta longe sanat unda refuso,
tyrrhenusque fretis immittitur aestus Auernis?

Pinder explains the MS. reading ludit ‘oi the quiet sportive
motion ol witers protected from winds’ But the sea was not calm
beoause shut out lrom Avernus.

2. To make uacua, etc. in apposition to penten is harsh in the
extreme, and unmeaning. Baiae was situated quite outside the Julian
harbour, ancl at some distance from it, on the western shore of the
Baianus Sinus. It is clear, however, that fumida stagna refers to
the Lucrine lake. The whole region is volcanic: and fumida refers
