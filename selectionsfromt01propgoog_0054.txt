TO PROPERTIUS. xlvii

nature, at once sensitive and passionate as it 'wasz and
the twenty-third and twenty-fourth poems of Book IV
show how for a time at least it converted the tenderest
of poets into the hardest. When there was no longer
a Cynthia, there could no longer be Cynthia poems : but
some of the finest, to a modern taste probably tlte finest,
of the poems of Propertius are written on subjects in
which Cynthia bad no place; and there is no need to
exaggerate the influence which she exercised on his
genius, and for that purpose to set aside the presumption
afforded by the order ol the poems as banded down to us
that 'some of the noblest and most beautiful of his poems
were composed after bis love lor Cynthia was a thing
of the past. The fevered dissipation of bis first youth
no doubt left its effects behind, and the exuberance of his
early muse departed from him 3 but no dimness of poetic
faculty, no seared beart, can be attributed to the poet who
wrote the third and the eleventh poems of the Fourtb
Book, and the latter, as we have seen, was written not
earlier than Β. c. 16.

Another argument, which is almost conclusive, can be
drawn from the development in tbe structure of the
elegiae couplet, and especially of the pentameter, which can
be traced in tbe poems as they stand. ln Books l and ΙΙ
· Propertius constantly ends bis pentameters with words of
three, four, and five syllables: the number of such end-
ings is far rarer in Book ΙΙΙ, and ceases almost entirely
in Book IV: in seven out of the eleven poems of that
book not one of these endings occur. Tbe following table
will show at a glance how the facts stand :—

Book Ι.Ι II. ΙΙΙ. 1v.
Trisyllabic endings .................. 35 15 1 1
Quadrisyllahic endings ,,,,,,,,,,,, 88 53 10 4
Quinquesyllabicending‘s ............ 8 7 1 1

The above table speaks for itself. It sbows that as the
books proceed, Propertius escbews more and more all
