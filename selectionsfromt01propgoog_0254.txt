tardis verginia, Abl. of Cause, ‘in consequence of the late
rising of the Vergiliae! The morning rising of the Vergiliae, or, to
use their Greek name, the Pleiades, was held in a rough way to mark
the commenoement oi spring, and of the sailing season. As to the
precise date indicated, there is great confusion in the writings of the
Roman poeta, arising mainly from two causes : (1) they did not dis·
tinguish between the true morning rising of a star (i. e. when it rises
at the same moment with the sun) from its apparent rising (i. e. when
it rises long enough before the sun to be visible before daylight); and
(2) they occasionally (Ovid especially) copied dates from Greek
astronomical writers without correcting their calculations for the date
or for the latitnde of Rome. In the year 44 Β. c, at Rome the true
morning rising of the Pleiades was on April 163 the apparent or
heliae rising was on May 28. According to the division of the seasons
in Caesar's Calendar, the beginning oi summer was marked by the

morning rising of the Pleiades, but whether the true or heliae rising ’

was meant is not stated. See W. Ramsay's Appendix on the Roman
Calendar, Selections from ovid, p. 358 sqq.
11. ruthena . . . uana. These words form a kind of rhyme
called leonine: cp. 1. 17. 5 ¹
Quin etiam absenti prosunt tibi Cynthio venti,
and 2. 8. 16

In nostrum tocies verba superba caput.
