262 NOTES.

above, and Virg. Aen. 8. 688, where Bactra (as elsewhere Britain) is
called ultima.

17,18. see note on a. 13. 37. Pagina detulit opus is somewhat
like cantarunt scri'pta Catulli 2. 34. 87.

Soram, oi me Muses, as in a. 30. ²7·

18. intaeta vta. Cp. Hor. Od. 3. 2. aa

Vinius . . . nugata tentat iter uia,
while in Sat. 1. 10. 66 he speaks of Lucilius as

· Graecis intacti carminis auctor.

All me poets of the Augustan age are equally emphatic in proclaim·
ing their own originality: so Virg. G. 3. 293 and Hor. Epp. 1. 19. 21

Libera par vacuum posui uestigia primnis,

Nan aliana nuo pressi pade,
though confessing, in the same bream, that it was only au originality
of imitation.

19. Βοιὼ refers to amatory poetry in opposition to the dura
of Epic. Cat. 16. 4 couples nnlliculi with parum pua'ui of his own
verses. So in 4.1'. 61 Ennius has a ln'rsuta corana, he himself asks
for one ax dedara. See note ou 2. 1. 41.

Pegasides, i.e. the Muses. The Greeks knew nothing of
Pegasus as the horse ol the Muses, beyond the fact that by a kick oi
his hoof he called up me inspiring sount ol Hippocrene. The
Roman poets abound in allusions to the poetic character of Pegasus,
and go so iar as to attribute to the spring oi Pirene, near Corinth,
where Pegasus was caught by Bellerophon, me same inspiring pro-
perties which were possessed by Hippocrene. Thus Persius couples
both the sam caballinus (Hippocrene) and pallida Pirene with the
Muses, Prol. 1. 4.

20. motet used absolutely, without a case. Cp. the phrase
facere, ‘to sacrifice,' where sacra must be supplied, Virg. E. 3. 77

Cum faciam vitula pro frugibus, ipsa venito.
So facere ad, like Mr. Matthew Amold's phrase, ‘to make for right-
eousness? Cp. ‘the things which make for peace,' Rom. 14. 19.
The verb is thus reduced to the mere expression of action, as in the
auxiliary use oi our da, does. We may almost translate here with
Postgate ‘will do ior!

21. Aa implies a transition to a new theme, the disparagement
oi his verses by detractors. Like Horace, Propertius suffered from,
and complained oi, the unworthy jealousy of rivals: Horace could
speak of it with the toleratiou and temper of a man oi the world,
and boasts at last that he has lived it down, Od. 4. 3. 16

Et iam dente minus mordear inuida.
