‘of ' is misleading: ‘the path of truth,' ‘the anvil of truth,’ etc, are
not analogous. The natural translation is ‘the standards now free,'
referring to the Roman force on Antouy's side, which before the
battle was enslaved to an Egyptian queen. Horace expresses the
same thing in the words quoted above, Epod. 9. 12

Emancipatus feminac.

63. ma, sc. Cleopatra: Pal. remarks how carefully the Roman
poets abstained from mentioning the hated Egyptian queen by her
name.

maie, i. e. from the Roman point of view. See note on Tib. 1.
1o. 51. ,

64. Boc num, in apposition to the sentence which follows
non rnmtura, etc There seems uo reason for considering this con·
struction as necessarily au accusative, as the commentators do: it
may be either accusative or nominative as the passage requires. Here
the nominative seems the natural-case, asin Virg. Aen. 6. ²23 ,

pars ingenti subiere feretro,
Triste ministerium
where the verb in apposition has a transitive meaning, the accusative
seems suggested, as in Aen. 9. 53, 8. 487, etc. But see Conington.

65. ni menas, taken with the words that follow, is better
taken as a statementthan in its usual meaning os a wish. ‘The gods
ordered better after all: for what (ie. how trumpery) a triumph
would it have been to see a woman borne along,' etc. The wish Di
melius! would only be appropriate in the mouth of some pne speak—
ing before Cleopatra’s fate was known, in which case ductus est
would be required for duetus crat. Hertz. well quotes Seneca, Epist.
98. 5, ¹who bids us solace ourselves under disappointments by saying
Di melius, i. e. ‘The gods, after all, have ordered it for the best' “

67, 68. quod aias . . . ratem an extravagant and tasteless idea.

70. ati, ‘with a view to joining)

exuit, ‘puts off,' ‘lays down.'

71. candida, in allusion to the cleaned or whitened garments
worn on feast-days: Hor. Sat. a. a. 61.

· 72. Blanditiae rosae, ‘the caresses, the allurements, of the
rose,’ i. e. ‘caressing roses:' for the expression see Postgate, Intro·
duction.

74. spica (lilim, i.e. saflron oil: used also for buming on
altars, Ov. Fani. 1. 76

Et sonet accemis spica Cilissa focis.

75. Scaliger’s conjecture irritat, adopted by Paley, merely re·

peats a commonplace: irritet couveys an invitation and its excuse.
