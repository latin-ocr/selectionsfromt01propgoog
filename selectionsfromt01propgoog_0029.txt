xxii INTRODUCTION

As to the actual cause of his losses, Tibullus preserves
a discreet silence: but it is generally taken for granted
that like Horace, Virgil, and Propertius, he was a victim
os the confiscations perpetrated by Octavianus and
Antony with the view of satisfying the-demands of their
disbanded soldiery. The confiscation from which Virgil
and Horace suffered took place alter the battle of Philippi
·in Β. c, 42. There were other confiscations in lac„ 36,
and again after Actium in Β. c. 31.

The probability is that the confiscation took place on
the first of these occasions, in B. e. 42 or 41. At that
time Tibullus, according to Dissen’s chronology, would
have been 17 or 18 years of age, and therefore just liable
for military service. To this date therefore he assigns
the 10th Elegy of the First Book, which the poet wrote
on the occasion os receiving his first summons to arms,
and in which he expresses in passionate language his
hatred of war and his longing for ease and peace. ln
this poem there is no mention of any loss of property: so
Dissen conjectures that the confiscation took place after
Tibullus had started for the wars, and that he did not
, return to his· reduced estate till tae. 32, when he would
have completed his full period of ten years' service in the
’ cavalry. According to this view, a period osten years
must be placed between the composition of the tenth and
the first Elegies of the First Book, sor in the latter poern,
written in Β. Ε, 31 (see Introduction), Tibullus tells us he
has completed his term of service, and is determined to
live the rest of his days in peace at home.

Dean Milman ¹, however, has pointed out one serious
difficulty in the way of this chronology. It is hard to be·
lieve that so finished a poem as 1.10can have been
written in boyhood: or that so long a period as ten
years-ten years too of rough camp-lise-can have elapsed
