TIBULLUS, 11. 1., 2-25. ’ 159

· The neuter seems to have the same sense as in the Psalm:
‘let everything that hath brenth prsise the Lord.’

non for ne in prohibitive sentences has a gentle dimuadve
meaning, emounting rather to a recommendation than an order:
Hor. Sat. n. 5. 91

Deffice'lem umerorum offendet garrulus ultro

Nun, etiam sileas:
‘you should not keep silence‚’ Pers. 1. 5

non, si quid turbide Roma

Elevet‚ accedeus.
Other instaures are Hor. Ep. 1. 18. 72, A. P. 460. In these pas·
sages the prohibitive meaning shades nearly oli into the conditional:
‘you would not keep silence‚' i. e. if you followed my advice.

15. eut. The lamb was sacrifioed after having been led thrice
round the ferm: Festus says, Ambarvalis hostia est quae ree' divinae
causa circum arua ducitur ab iis qui pre frugibus faciunt. So
Virg. Geo. 1. 345

Terque novas circum felix eat hostia fruges.

19. neu secer eludet mensem. The harvest or crop itsell
is said to be mocked with vain hopes, in place of the husbandmen.
Hor. 3. 16. 30 expresses exactly the same idea by et segetis cerea
fides meae, as though the erop had given a promise which it loyally
redeemed. Cp. Virg. Geo. 1. 225. The herbae are the green blades
which never corne to maturity. Ov. Her. 17. 263 puts the idea into
aproverb‚

’ Sed nimium properas et adleuc tua messis in herba est.

21. nitidus, ‘sprucez’ Hor. Epp. 1. 4. 15.

23. The master, having feasted royally, is in e good temper,
seeds his slaves from his table, and looks kindly on their sports.
Cp. Hor. Od. 3. 17. 16 cum famulis operum solutis, and Epp. 2. 1.
¹4² Curre sociis operum, pueris et coniuge fida.

24. The allusion seems to be to extempore arbours put up by the
slaves near the altar, in which to drink and be merry. The names
pergula, trichila were given to them: they are described iu Ov.
Fast. 3. 527
Sub Iove pars durat: pauci tentoria ponunt:
Sunt quibus e ramis frondea sacta case est;
Pars sibi pro ngidis calamos statuere columnis,
Demper extentas imposuere togas.
See Tib. 2. 5. 97. -
25. hennae, i. e. ‘prayers that will be fulfilled!
