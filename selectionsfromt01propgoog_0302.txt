PROPERTJUS,11. 10., 13-18. 235

· tinually to see whether heis pursuing. But the Euphrates is here

represented as a Parthian river, not as a Roman river (Crassos se
tenuisse dolet), and there would be no point in saying that the Parthian
river was no longer running away from a victorious foe. The point
is that the Euphrates repents ol having kept the Crassi, and ,declares
that his horsernen no longer cast that terrible glauce behind thern.

14. saumana, ‘that it kept them‚' i. e. instead of sending them
backunhurt. '

15. The word 1adia is probably here used in poetic exaggera-
tion. The only known relationbetween Augustas aud India is that
an Indian embassy is.meutioned amongst others as having reached ·
him in ne. ao when in the East. Postgate supposes the reference
to be to a previous embassy oi which Dion Cassius speaks in vague
tems, 54. 9. The poet speaks grandly‚ as though the whole East
were submitting to Augustus ; the only foundation in fact for such a
boast being that Augustus was meditating an expedition against
Arabia, and had begnn to iutrigne in Parthian affairs. Arabia was
probably looked upon vaguely as being on the road to India;
’ hence Horace conples the two together, Od. 3. 24· 1

Intactis opulentior .
Thesauris Arabum ct divitis [Maiae.

16. intactae, ‘unrifled.' ,
Arabiae. The allusion is to the disastrous expedition against
Arabia, conducted by Aelius Gallus in ac. ²4· Horace alludes to

this expedition, Od. ι, ²9· 1
Ι Icci, beatis nuuc Arabum invides
Gaaia “

As the commentators point out, the words te tremit point to a time
previous to the disaster,

Araura has here the first syllable long, for sake of the metre, as
in 1. 14. 19. Poets allow themselves great license in the case of
proper names Thus we have ltdlus and Itdlus, Sicaniis, Sr‘cdulzis
and buccinis, C y'tlzird and Cytherea and we need not feel squeamish

about admitting Apulus side by side with Apulia? in'the much· ,

tortured passage Hor. Od. 3. 4. 9, 10
Mc fabulosae Vulture in Appula
Altricis extra limen Apuliae,
where none oi the proposed emendations deserve adoption.

17, 18. These lines complete the circle of prophetie boastful-
ness. The reference in l. 17 is of course to Britain. So Horace in
Od. 1. 21.13,an Ode which was probably written iu rac. 28, pro-
phesies victories to Augustus over East and West alike:
