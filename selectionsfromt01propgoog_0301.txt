erowning triumph of Augustus‘ foreign policy; and it was deemed
so essentia] to his position as sole ruler of Rome that he should
obtain a great success over the Parthians, that it is not only per-
petually celebrated in terms of triumph by the court poeta after it was
obtained, but it is frequently referred to in anticipation. Thus the
mere mention of a Parthian victory is by no means sufficient in
itself to prove that the passage in which it occurs was written after
13. c. 20. The famous lines in Virg. Geo. 3. 30 sqq„ in which
the Armenian and Parthian successes of Augustus seem to be
alluded to, were in all probability written iu a tone of prophecy3
for Virgil died in B. e. 19, and the Georgius were written at least teu
years before the events supposed to be referred to occurred. The
same explanation is to be given with regard to Hor. Od. 2. 10.
18-20, where Parthian successes are spoken of in an Ode which from
other causes can scarcely be dated later than Β. e. 2 3.

ln the magnificent statue of Augustus, which now adorus the
Braccio Nuovo in the Vaticau, and which was dug up in the Villa
Livia at the Sacra Rubra (now Prima Parta) iu 1863, the cuirass is
beautifully sculptured with figures indicating the leading events of
his life. The principal place in the centre is occupied bya represen-
tation of the Parthian envoys handing over the standards to Tiberius.

13. equitem pont terga tueri. In allusion to the mode of
fighting peculiar to the Parthians, which struck terror into the
Roman imagination. Their chief arm was a light cavalry, who
were armed with bows and shot from horseback. They were in
fact a species os mounted infantry, peculiarly adapted to a desert
country where the great heat, the want of water and supplies, the
long distances and the buming saud, rendered the Roman system of
fighting practically impossible. Thus Virg. Geo. 3. 31
Fidentamque suga Parthum, versisque sagittis.

Cp. Hor. Od. 2. 13. 17; in Sat. 2. 1.15,in a passage exactly parallel
to this, he declares it is not every poet that causing of wars,

Aut labentis equa describat vulnera Parthi. .
Cp. Persius 5. 4

Vulnera seu Parthi ducentis ab inguine ferrum.
So again, Prop. 3v9· 54 describes the Parthian flying shots as

Parthorum astutae tela remissa sugat.

R. Ellis, Phil. Journ. xv. p. 14, objects to the'usual rendering
of this passage, as not giving the natural meaning of the words,
He thinks that the expression is obviously taken from an army or
commander retreating before a victorious sae, and looking back con-
