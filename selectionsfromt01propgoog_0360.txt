PROPERTIUS‚ III. 7., 19-22. 293

beloved by Agamemnon, who also met his death by drowning. The
ancient passages in which the legend is mentioned are quoted by
Mr. Ellis, vis. Plut. Gyrilli'y, Athen. 13. 8, Clemens Alex. Protrept.
⁸ rr. 20, Sylburg.,and Steph. Byz. Argynnus. They all connect Argyn-
nus with the mainland of Greece; in two the Cephissus is named spe·
cially as the river in which he was drowned; in another the Boeotian
lake Copais is named in connection with the incident. As the Cephis-
sus is out of the question here, Mr. Ellis supposes that Propertius
followed some other legend, which connected the drowning of
Argynnus with some point on the coast of Asia Minor. Out of
several names which might be connected with Argynnus, he selects
the promontory Argennum, exactly opposite to the island of Chios,
and conjectures Mimantis for minantis, showing that in MSS. Mimas
has frequently been corrupted into minas, minan, and similar forms.
Mount Mimas is one of the three mountainous projections into
which the peninsula between Teos (S.) and Clazomenae (N.) spreads
itself out. Mr. Ellis points out that Agamemnon was specially
honoured near Clazomenae (Paus. 7. 5. 6); aud there were probably
Agamemnon legends all along the Ionian coast. Assuming therefore
that ‘the waters of Mimas' might be used to denote a point on the
shore near to the promontory of Argennum, he proposes to read either
(a) Quae natat Argynni poena, Mimantis aquae,
making aquae in apposition to litora, and translating ‘Shores sig· Ι
nalised by the punishment of Argynnus, the waters of Mimas which
drowned him :’ or else
(b) Qua notat Argynni poena Mimantis aquas.

He prefers the former reading, as involving a slighter change,
and as being more recondite. The authority of Mr. Ellis will doubt-
iess commend this reading to future editors: but I venture, with much
diffidence, to think that there are strong reasons against it. For (1)
there is no legend that Argynnus was punished for anything. (α) The
‘waters of Mimas’ is a somewhat strange expression to denote a point
on the shore near Mount Mimas. (3) Strictly speaking, the promon-
tory Argennum was not on any part of Mount Mimas at all. It was
on a spur of Mount Corycus, forming the Western spur of the three-
pronged peninsula, while Mimas was the Northern. The passage
quoted by R. Ellis from Strabo gives Mimas its true position, be·
tween Erythrae and Hypocremnus No great weight perhaps need
be attached to this point, for Mimas was apparently the best-known
name of the three, and Propertius mayhave had in his mind the
words of Odys. 3. 172 ,

ἣ ὑπένερθε Χίοιο, παρ’ ἠνεμόεντα Μίμαντα.
