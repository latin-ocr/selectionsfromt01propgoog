210 NOTES.

mouns, of a rival in love. So above, 8. 27, rumpantur iniqui.
It is hard to see how Pinder gets the meaning ‘a passion alien to me.’

24 certa, i.e. even a faithful maiden.

minis, the threats of interested friends. Paley quotes Ov. Fast.

2. 80⁶ Nec prece, mc pretio, mc movet ille minis.

25. quare. Prosaic as the word seems, Propertius is fond of
introducing a fmal conplet with it: so 1. 5. 31 and 9. 33. The
word has reference not to the lines immediately preceding, but to
the general sense of the whole piece. ‘With the grave and all its
doubts thus before us, let us love while we may.’ The absence of
caesura in this line makes it very inharmonious.

26. ullo tempore can only mean ‘in any time, however long :’
‘No time is long enough for love? This indefinite use of ullus, to
signify time of boundless duration, is peculiar. The idea is, ‘Yon could
name no time—i.e. no period of time-which would be long for love!

25, 26. This last couplet recalls the exquisite lines of Catullus:

Vincamus, mea Lesbia, atque amemus:

Soles occidere et redire possunt:
Nobis, quum semel occidit bream lux,
Nox cst perpetua una domanda.

I. 22.

Propertius closes this first Book of his Elegies after the manner of

Roman poets (see esp. Hor. Epp. Lao) with an autobiographicalrefer·
encetohimself. It is addressed toTullus-the same Tullus,presumably,
to whom the 1st‚ oth, and 14th Elegies of this book are addressed—in
answer to hisqueries asto the poet’s birth. He was born, he says, in
Umbria, where that province comes closest to the walls of Perusia.

l. qualis, as well as unde, is to be taken with gentas. ‘What
and whence my family, yon ask! The double interrogation is frequent
in Greek, commonly without a copula, as ποῦ πόθεν γεγώςς etc.

qualis genus can scarcely mean, as Postgate puts it, ‘of what
kind of family‚' but rather ‘of what kind in point of family,' i. e. ‘ of
whatfamily.'

l’snates, the proper Latin equivalent for ‘Home’ It is
doubtful whether the word dantus ever bears this meaning.

2. pro nostra amicitia, a common phrase. In this and
similar phrases pro indicates that there is a proportion, a corre
spondence, a natural connection, between the thing said or done and
the noun govemed by the proposition. Yon ask me ‘asa friend;’
