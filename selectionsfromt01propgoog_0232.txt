Rome, aud formed, sor a long period, a political engine of great
power. They were originally deposited in a stone chest, ,under
ground, in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus, and were committed to
the charge oi inspectore or commissionem chosen from among the
patricians, whose duty it was to consult them when authorised by
the Senate. The number of commissionem was originally two, who
were styledduumuiaisacrorum or duumviri libris adeundas. In the
year Β, c. 368, a bill was brought iu by the tribunes to increase the
number of commissionem from two to ten, with the condition that
one-half of· these should be plebeians. Aster great opposition, the
bill was' carried the following year, and continued in sorce until the
