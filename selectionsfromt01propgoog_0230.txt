TIBULLUS, 11. 1., 61-86. 163

has passed through a village where hand-looms are stillin use. See
the carefnl description of weaving in Ov. Met. 6. 54

Haud mara, causiuunt diversis partibus aaziae,

Et gracili gentinus intendunt stamine telas.

Tela iugo vincta cst; stanter secernit amuda ,⁰

Inseritur madium radiis subtemen acuas,

Quod digiti expediunt, atquc intcr stamina ductum

Percussa feriunt insccti pectine cientes.

73. detraxit, tuate. Perfecta of Habit; what has hap·
pened once may be expected to happen again, so that the ¹tense ex·
pressing a single occasion may stand for a repeated act. A good
instance is Virg. Geo. 4. ²14

rege incolumi mens amnibus uua cst:
Amissa rupcrc fidem, constructaque malla
Diripuere ipsu.
Cp. Geo. 1. 49.

75-79. A charmingly natural picture of a maiden stealthily
getting up in the dead of night, slipping past the slaves who guard
the door, and feeling her way in the darlr, by foot and hand, that
she may meet her lover.

77. redibas auspenaa, ‘on tip-toe.’

78. Cp. Ov. Met. 10. 455

Nutricisquc manum lacau tenet .· altera matu
Caecum itcr explorat.

cul manus, ‘while her hand! The force of cui here is not so
much that of simul, or atquc ctiam, or dum, as Pinder says, but
rather is pictorial, as though a picture or a statue vvere being
described: the foot feeling its way, the expression of sear, the
exploring hand, form evidently one representation; the two lines
give not a narrative, but an attitude. So a. 3. 43, quoted by Pinder,
describes a character, not a course of conduct: while Virg. Aen. 4.
138 is exactly parallel to the passage before us:

Cui pharetra cx aura, crines nodantur in aurum,

Aurea purpuream subnectit fibula vcstcm.
ln all these cases we may translate by ‘while’ using the word how-
ever not in its temporal, but in its adversative, sense.

81. vent daptbus, not so much ta, assor, the feast.

83. deum, i. e. Cupid.

ymeri, a similar dative to dapibus above; but the conjunction
of pecori vacate uoce, ‘call upon him for the flock with the voice,' is
somewhat harsh.

86. obstrepit, ‘makes a din against,' i, e. so that your prayer
