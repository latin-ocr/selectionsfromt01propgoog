to its full intellectual strength, and in attaching to himself and his
govemment, as enthusiastic champions, the master-minds iu whom
that intellectual strength was embodied. Napoleon III tried in vain
to attach to himself the intellect of ance, and he fell: Angustus

form, was the Rome of the Augustan age, we can without difficulty

Livy, Ovid, Propertius, and Tibullus were, after all, only the brightest

the instrumentality of Maecenas. With Propertius, as with Horace,
Maecenas used all his influence, under cover of a regard for his
literary reputation, to induce him to turn his muse to higher themes,
to urge her to soar a higher flight; Propertius, like Horace, under

1. amores, poems on Love. Writers of Love poetry are con·
stantly apologising for not tumiug to graver themes. Cp. Spenser,
Faen'c Queene, Bk. 4, Introduction:

My looser rimes, I wate, dote sharply wite
For praising Leve, as I have done of late,
And magnifying lovers‘ deor debete.

real predicate. Whether in orerefers to the mouth of some one reading
out the poems, or to the poet’s own mouth, is not clear ; probably the
latter. The poet is supposed to recite the book as he composes it.

3. calliope, the Epic muse.
