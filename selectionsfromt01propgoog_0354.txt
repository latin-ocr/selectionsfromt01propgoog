111. 7· ¹

A YOUNG friend oi the poet, called Paetus, had been drowned in
the course of a voyage to Egypt, whither he was bound on some
trading venture. Assuming therefore that lust ior gold was the cause
of his friend’s end, Propertius describes with much pathos the circum-
stances of his death, and moralises upon the avarice of man and the
rash daring which it inspires. It is one ¹of the most beautiful of his
pieces, full oi an exquisite tender pathos, and showing a high
imaginative capacity, such as is rarely to be found in ancient poetry,
for feeling and interpreting thewilder moods of nature. This poem
would alone be enough to refute the common idea that Propertius
was a mere love poet, whose one aud only inspiration was found¹ in
Cynthia. On the contrary, it raises the presumption that Cynthia
did as much to degrade or divert his muse as to create it, und fills
one with regret that he did not-devote his genius to nobler themes.
