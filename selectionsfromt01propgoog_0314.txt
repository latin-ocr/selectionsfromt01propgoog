PROPERTJUS,11.13., 34-55. 247

42. aa verum napis, ‘has some sense towards, in the direc-
tion of, truth!

conscia, is simply ‘conscions’ ‘sentient:’ here the spirit is not
only conscious, but ad verum sapit, i. e. can form true ideas. -

43. primis cunta, ‘the cradle that ushers in life ς’ exactly
like extremus in 3. a. aa

Mortis ab extrema condicione vacant.

ponere, ‘to lay down,’ 'give np.'

45. quo, ⁸ for what purposel' constructed both with ὼε ιιοιιι.

47. The MSS. have Quis tam longaevae, which is clearly
corrupt. Hertz. has Cui si longaevae: the correction Cui si tam lon-
gae seems best. eut si written in one word would become quis, and
then longae would be lengthened into longaevae for the metre.

48. The first word is quite uncertain: the two first letters were
probably lost in the archetype, as Palmer suggests. Gallicus is a
very unnatural word to use of a Phrygian in reference to the Homeric
period: Ilius (Lachmann) would give a harsh jingie: and bellicus
(Palmer) is'tame. Postgate justly thinks that a proper name is
required; and would defend Gallicus as referring to Hector, the
Γάλλος being a river in Phrygia (Herodiant. 11. a), with which
Hector may have been connected ιιι some legend. If Memnon

. be referred to, who killed Antilochus while defending his father, he ’

thinks the passage corrupt.

49. This passage was evidently ιιι Juvenal's mind when he
wrote Sat. ιο. 246-255.

51. nouis, a gentle request, as above, ll. 27, 29.

53. qui, the MS. reading, has been needlessly altered to cni.
Palmer well quotes Ov. Her. ao.1o3: the word testis does not imply
that ‘a boar wasa witness to a moral truth' (Paley)‚ any more than

Hor. Od. 3. 4. 69

Testis mearum centimanus Gyas
Sententiarum

implies that the giant Gyas gave evidence in support of Horace's
opinions. Testis simply means ‘ affords proof or evidence of.'

55. Illis, with reference to Idalia vertice.

By an awkward construction, dicitur must be supplied to go
with lavisse from diceris isse 1. 56.

lavisana practically certain reading of Per. for iacuisse, adopted
by Scal. and Professor Palmer, who informs me that H. A. J. Munro
approved of it. To make Adonis lie in marshes is absurd‚ and
