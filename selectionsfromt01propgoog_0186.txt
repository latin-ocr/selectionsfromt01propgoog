TJBULLUS, 1.1., 52-72. 119

treatise De Romanis Familiis; but his fame rested chiefly on his
¹oratoricul efforts, which were characterised by great purity of style
and neatness ol expression, and by a loity and generans tone, though
considered deficient in strength. N one oi his works have been pre·
served, with the exception of a lew insignificant fragments! '

Ι 54. Referring to the costam oi hanging up' upon the door·
posts spoils won from the enemy. So Prop. 3. b. 26

Atque onerare teeom fixa per arma domum.
See Virg. Aen. 7. 183. ’ “
58. Roman slaves who' acted as janitore were not unsrequently
chained, like dogs, to their posts. So Ov. Am. 1. 6. 1

Ianitor, indignum! dura religate catena.

57. leus is especially used ol military renown: Prop. 1. 6. 29 ¹

¹ Non ego sum laudi, mon natm idoneus amnes.
60. Imitated by Ovid in his Elegy on Tibullus, Am. 3. 9. 58
Me tenuit moriens deficieme manu.

63, 64. terro vincte. This does not mean merer that his
breast is ‘inclosed in,’ ‘encased by iron' (Pind.), but rather that it
is tight bound, aud therefore hard, because made of iron.

67. menes ne laede. Flere et crines solutos tatere consenta-
neum, si vero etalem abscinderet crines Delia et genas laceraret, aegre
ferrem troc Manes poetae, quibus etiam in Orco cura formosae
puellae. D. Immodico luctu eororam Manes oſj‘ende' aut putabant,
aut poetae saltem eleganter pronuntiant. H. ‘We find the same idea ι
in Prop. 4. 11. 1

Desine, Perille, meum lacrimis urgere sepulcrum!

69. tongere in this sense is properly used with an acc. oi the

persons joined together, as Ov. Met. 4. 156
Ut quos serus amor, quos hora eeovissima iunxit ,·

cp. the word coniux, one joined to another. But it is also used, as
here, with a quasi-cognate acc. ol the union formed, in such phrases
as, iungere pacem, foedera, amicitiam, or as here amorem ,· cp. Cat.
6 . a

4 3⁷ Quare agite, optatos animis coniungite amores.

72. licentii be read, it should probably be taken as au old
form of the abl. as in Cat. 66. 1²4· Capite is supported by Plaut.
Merc. a. π.

T eiri’ capite cano amas?
On the other hand, the dat. with an infin. aiterit is not unex-
ampled with decet: e. g. Liv. 34. 58. 8 Sicut aut solo‘aut prima
certe pensari decet principi orbis terrarum populo. So Dig. 3²· 1. ²3·
