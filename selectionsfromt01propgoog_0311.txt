21. tulero eburno, ablativa of quality or description; the
lectus is the funeral bier, often richly omamented, on which the
body was carried to burial.

Attalico, either ‘sumptuous’ from the wealth ol the kiugs of
Pergamus, as in Hor. od. 1. 11Attalicis condicionibus ,· or, as Post-
gate suggests, ‘embroidered with gold,' au art which Plin. N. H.
8. 48 attributes to the last Attalus. Cp. Attalicas vestes 3. 18.19.
In o. 32. 12 the handsome hangings iu the Pom'cus Pompeio are
called aulaeo Attalica.

22. mora mea, i. e. ‘my body when dead,’ ‘my dead body.'
Exactly similar arethe expressions nostras vitoe, 1. o. 31, ‘tome so
long as Ι live ς’ nuo poeno o. 20. 31, ‘myrshade while undergoing
punishment ;’ nuum sunus 1. 17. 8, ‘my dead body.' Cp. Virg.
Aen. . 1

9 49 Et sunus lacerum tellus habet? ,

23. lanolhua. For the dative we should here expect the
genitive, ‘let no chargers be arrayed‚’ i. e. ‘let there be uo array of
chargersss Perfumes were thrown on the body when first laid out,
crassisque lutatus amomis Pers. 3. 103; they were carried in
chargers along with the procession, as here; they were thrown on to
the body when placed on the rogus ; they were finally mingled with
the ashes before they were deposited in the um. The sensas of
smell and hearing must thus have been fully occupied at a Roman
funeral. When Juvenal wishes to describe an over-scented fop he
makes him reek quantum vix redolent trio funera Sat. 4. 1093 and
when Horace describes an overpowering din, he says

Cornua quod vincatque tubas,
i.e. those of a funeral, Sat. 1. 6. 44. A funeral conducted without
pomp was called tacitum funus, ‘a quiet funeral :' a phrase which
' strikes strangely ou our ears. Cp. Ov. Tr. 1. 3. 22.

25. This line has not unnaturally been interpreted to prove
that Propertius when he wrote this Elegy must have'published at
least two complete books, and have been engaged upon a third. But
we have already seen that the arguments tor supposing that the first
ten Elegies of Book ΙΙ. formed a completed book are of little
weight3 and the whole treatment of the subject of death in this
elegy is so imaginative and unreal—not real enough to be called
morbid—that it is unuecessary to suppose a reference here to any
actual number of completed or ewen contemplated books. Three
books form a modest complete number; less than three would be
meagre, either for a poet or a procession; three was the number
os bools which Horace first published as a completed edition of his
