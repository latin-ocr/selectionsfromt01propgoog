who received the honour of having the hill called after him asa
reward of his iniusta sors, i. e. iu finding the gate betrayed, in spite
of his own loyalty, by his daughter.

Tffls poem is a paean over the great victory of Augustus at

Aetium, like the ninth Epode of Horace. It has not, however, the
merit of having been written at the time; it was not composed till '
nc. 16, on the occasion of the third celebration, under Agrippa, of
the ludi quinquennales on the Palatine‚ games instituted by a
decree of the Comitia in Β. c. 28 in perpetual commemoration of the
victory. They are not to be eonfounded with the similar gemes,
also quinquennales, instituted on the spot itself by Augustus imme-
diately after the victory.

1. Once more the poet assumes the character of a priest about
to perform a sacrifice. The first teu lines contain the exordium
worked out with more than usual elaboration. The description of
the battle itself takes the form of a solemn hymn in honour of the
Palatine Apollo, to whom the victory was due; and the pieoe ends ν
with an invitation to sacrificial revelry, as in Horace’s Epode. The

exordium and the hymn that follows are connected in exactly the .

same way as in Hor. Od. 3. 1: see note on Prop.3. 1.

3. cere, though not wholly satisfactory, is better than any other
reading proposed: though in sense, Paley's hadra, if possible, would
do well enough. All through the exordium Propertius mingles
the poetic with the sacrificial terms3 and in l. 3 cernet, followedby
corymbis, requires that its subject should relate to song. Thus aro
(Haupt) will not do; serta may be right, as it contracte best with
corymbis, and Propertius uses the feminine form, 2. 33. 37. Cera
must mean the waren tablet on which the song was written.
