240¹ NOTES.

Propertius, though he has failed to express himself clearly, meant to
convey the idea found in Moschus 2. 17
⁵ nol πτερόεις ὡς ὄρνις ἐφίπταται ἄλλον ἐπ’ ἄλλῳ
ἀνέρας ἠδὲ γυναῖκας, ἐπὶ σπλάγχνοις δὲ κάθηται.

But here two ideas are conveyed: (1) the god flits from one person
to another, (a) he sits upon the σπλάγχνα, It is evident that the
words humano cordavolare can mean neither the one nor the other ;
and what is the meaning ol love sitting upon the urldyxvul lt
may either be that he takes his station on the heart, as his natural
seat and abode; or that he perches there as a bird oi prey, to seed
on the vitals ol the man, as the eagle on the liver of Prometheus.
Postgate quotes line 15 in favour ol his view; but the very next line
seem to show the true meaning oi ἐπὶ σπλάγχνοις κάθηται :

Evolat heu! nostro quoniam de pectore nusquam,
Assiduusque mco sanguine bella gerit,

i. e. the god never leaves his breast bnt carries on the war with his
οιονι blood. Postgate’s explanation, ‘my blood accompanying,’ seems
unmeaning. In lines 5 and 6 there is nothing about war, blood, or
, preyingz‘they simply say that the artist properly represented Iove
as fumished with wings and ‘made him humano corde fly as a god.'
Can these words not mean ‘possessed of the cor (i. e. the heart, the
feeliugs, and so almost the personality), oi a man, but flying with
wings as a godl' Humano corde would thus be an ablative of
quality. Cor is used, and especially corculum, to denote a person;
and the position ol the words suggests an antithesis between humano
and deum. ln such a connection it is not unnatural to say that
Love is represented as having a human beart, i. e. as a man, and
at the same time flying as only a god can fly. If humano corde
be an ablative of place, the only way oi extracting Postgate's mean-
ing would be to translate ‘ fliessrom the human heart,¹ i. e. from one
to another. Baehrens reads hunuano calce. He probably means
the allusion to beto the talaria, or small wings attached to the beel,
which we see in representatione of Cupid and Mercury.

7. The idea os flying in air suggests that of floating on rising
and falling waves‚ at the caprice of every wind.

, 8. nostra, like suus, applied to a wind, naturally suggests the
idea of ‘favourable' But in itself, as here, ‘our wind' simply
means ‘the wind which bears οε] any further meaning depending
on the comat

non ullis ῑοοίιι, exactly parallel to nusquam line 15.
10. pharetra Gnosia, i. e. Cretan, from Gnosus or Gnosos

(Κνωσός), now Cnosson, the abode of Minos and the ancient capital
