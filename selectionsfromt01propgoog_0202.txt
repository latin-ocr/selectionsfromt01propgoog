, Ι. 7.

Tnts poem is a birthday panegyric in celebration of the triumph
os his patron Messalla, and of the various great services by which
that triumph was earned. The triumph took place on the a4th
Sept. Β. c, 27, and it would,seem that Messalla's birthday must
have fallen a few days after that event, so that the poet is able
dexterously to weave together the two causes of congratulation. An
outline of Messalla's career has been given already in the note to r.
1. 53. The poet begins by celebrating his ¹patron's victories in
Aquitania, and enumerates the various tribes which he subdued.'
He then passes on to describe his mission to the East, to which he .
appears to have been appointed at the close of iac. 30. During
the course of that year Augustus had received the submission of
Syria from Antony's legate Didius; the Antonian troops in Egypt
had surrendered, Antony and Cleopatra had committed suicide, and
from the rst of August Egypt had formally been made into ‘a Roman
province. Augustus prepared once more to winter at Samos rather
than return to Rome, not only because Samos was a central spot ,
from which he could ukeep an eye upon the course of affairs in the
East, but also because he wished to allow matters to ripen in the
City, and to make the need of his presence there the more keenly felt.
With' this view he had to keep his own hands free : so he summoned
over Messalla from Aquitania, and entrusted him apparently with a·
general mission to make aprogress in ,the East, to settle the
provinces, and to see that the dispositions made by himself
¹were carried into effect. In the course of this mission he passed
through Syria, Cilicia and Egypt. Augustus himself returned to
Italy in tac. 293 Messalla did not return to Rome till B.c. η
when he celebrated his triumph for his ,Aquitanian successes,
Tibullus accompanied Messalla upon this mission as far as Corcyra, .
where he was taken ill, as we saw in Elegy 3, artd was obliged to
stay behind.

It will be noted that Tibullus in this poem gives especial promi·
nence to Egypt, its gods and its fertility, and connects the acquisition of
that country with the inauguratiou of a new era of peace and plenty.
Egypt had by this time become the main granary ot‘KBm'e l'ils'sffl'e
keeping became a matter of special concern to the emperor; and its
inclusion within the strong grasp of the Roman system was justly

regarded as a pledge not less of economic prosperity than of political
security. ’
