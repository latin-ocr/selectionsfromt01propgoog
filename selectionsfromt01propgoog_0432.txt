Increpet absumptum mc sam mater Ityn.

60. tre, scarcely, ‘fall :' rather ‘go forth,' ‘ havetheir course.’

‘flow,' as in3.1.8

loem'mas elicuique deo.

61. vasus, supposed to referto a robe'of honour presented to
matrons who had borne three children: Dion. Cass. 55. a. The
phrase stolatae feminae on inscriptions has been held to refer-to this
distinction.

62. lieo mea . . . rapina, ‘I was not snatched.’

68. Her two sons: the elder, consul ab. 1, was called L.
Aemilius Paullus ,· the younger was called M. Aemilius Lepidus,
and was consul Α. n. 6. Why the cognomina of the two brothers
were different is not clear. ·

65. Her brother, P. Cornelius Scipio, was consul B. c, 16, and
had therefore presumably filled two curule offiees previously, the
curule aedileship aud the, praetorship.· Tempore means ‘betimes ;'
or ‘just at the right moment? Having seen her brother occupy
two curule offices and finally elected to the consulship, she was
‘felix opportunitate mortis’ Tempore might also mean ‘too soon;’
or again simply‘ just at that time,’ ‘at the very moment ’(= eo ipso
tempore), i. e. when he had been elected consul, and before he had
actually held the office. '

Paley explains th'e line as ‘abrief or rat ther a confused way of
expressing qui cum comui faetus esset, eo tempore rapto est soror
eim, or ,cuius consulatus tempore rapta est soror ;' or else with
Hertzberg would make tempore an ablative of the instrument.
Munro, Joum. of Phil. vol. 6. p. 62, declares the former view
meaningless, the latter out of place, and proposes

v Consule quo, festo tempore rapta soror.
Postgate reads laeto, which has the same meaning. But the idea of
either word is ont of plaoe here: she is narrating bare facts in this
passage, in a tone of pride, not of grief, aud the pathetic reference
to her dying in atime of joy is uncalled for. Another solution is
more probable. Iwould suggest that quo is used here, by a kind
of confusion, in a double construction, to be taken both with consule
and with tempore: ‘At which time, just as he had been made con-
sul, his sister was carried off,' or ⁸ Who having been made consul
just at that time, his sister was carried off! Horace is extremely
fond of placing words in positions where they are meant to be
