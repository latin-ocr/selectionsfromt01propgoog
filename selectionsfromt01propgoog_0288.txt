morcarum, 11. 1., 34-38. 221

say‘the body‚' as distinguished from the mind or soul. From thus ·

meaning ‘the physical life' or ‘body,' the word came to be used
specially as a term of endearment, as what is primarily loved, or
at least caressed, is the body, not the mind. Thus in Plautus we

· ¹ have such phrases as caput carum, secacum, lepidissimum, ridiculum,

and in Virg. Aen. 4. 354
Me puer Ascanius capitisque intum‘a cari.

It thus comes about that while we may sometimes, as above, have
to translate cor by ‘head,’ so we may sometimes render caput by
‘heaut’ asin the passage before us. Carum captat is just ‘dear
heart; ' cp. the Greek otton ἦτορ. Other special meanings of caput,
such as capitis poem, ‘capital punishment,' caput, ‘the snm of a
Roman citizen's rights,’ etc, are derived from the sense of ‘ life.’

37, 38. These lines have been generally misunderstood, and

in consequence the connection of ideas has been made to appear ,

more abrupt than it really is. Two cases of famous friendships are
appealed to-that of Theseus and Pirithous, and that of Achilles
'and Patroclus. Theseus, king of Athens, proved his friendship for
Pirithous, son of Ixion (hence Ixiontlies), by assistiug him in his
mad endeavour to carry off Proserpina from the lower world.
Achilles showed his affection for Patroclus, son of Menoetius (hence
Menoetiades), by the fury with which he avenged his death, and by
giving up for that purpose his anger against the Greeks. Accord-
ing to the common interpretation, these cases are referred to simply
as instanoes of great friendships‚ with which Propertius wished to
compare the friendship of Augustus and Maecenas. Thus the two
lines serve to illustrate only l. 34, and the meaning is, ‘Theseus
in the world below,’ lit. ‘to those below,' ‘Achilles in the world
above, call Pirithous and Patroclus as witnesses to their friendship.'
But this rendering breaks the coherence of the passage, aud dis-
connects entirely l. 33 from ll. 37-40, which contain its main idea.
Testatur may mean not only ‘calls to witness,' ‘summons as
witnesses,' bnt also ‘bears witness to,' ‘attests,' as in 3. 7. 21
Sunt Agamemnonias testantia littora curat.

Propertius has just said, ‘ I would sing the deeds of Angustus and
thine, Maecenas, his faithful friend, hadI the power.' He goes on,
‘Theseus to the world below, Achilles to the world above, bear
testimony to their friends Pirithous and Patroclus ; but Callimachus
had not the power to thnnder forth the battles of Zeus, nor have I
the power to tell in heroic verse the glories of Angustus? Thus the
connection of ideas is complete. No doubt in naming these heroic
friendships the poet intended also to imply that the friendship of
Augustus and Maecenas was as notable as theirs; bnt his main
