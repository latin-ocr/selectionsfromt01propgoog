the sense requires ceam. The allusion to Ennius is slight; it occurs
only in the pentameter; and to take up six lines with details of what
Ennius wrote as a reason why Prop'ertius should sing something
different, has neither sense nor propriety. Propertius had tremblingly
touched the mighty fount with his lips ,² he dreamed that he essayed,
in consequence, to follow the example of Ennius, when (l. 13) he was
stopped by Phoebus.

8. The allusion, without doubt, is to the triumphal return of L.
Aemilius Paullus from his great victory over Perseus, the king of
Macedon, Β. c. 167. Livy describes his magnificent progress up the
Tiber, 45. 35 Paullus ipsc post dies paucos regia nave ingentis mog-
nitudinis quam sexdecim vernes remorum agebant, ornma Macedonicis
spoliis, non insignium tontum urniorum, sed ctiam regiorum texti·
lium, adverso Tiberi ad urbem cst subuectus, completis ripis obuiam
effusa multitudine.

Those editors who read cecinit hold themselves compelled
to pass by this unmistakeable allusion because Ennius died two
years before tho event occurred, and refer to the comparatively obscure
defeat of Demetrius of Pharos by L. Aem. Paullus the father in Β. c.
²19· But even so, it is scarcely necessary to suppose that Propertius
would have been so accurate in his chronology or his quotations.

9. victrices moras, iu allusion to the famous waiting policy
of the Dictator Q. Fabius Maximus throughout the latter part of the
year 217 Β. o: the words of Ennius were

Unus iconio nobis cunctando restituit rem,
closely imitated by Virg. Aen. 6. 847.
10. versos, used exactly in the scriptura] sense of ‘tuming' the

heart: so 2. 28. 32
Et deus et durus vertitur ipse dics.

The reference is still to Fabius who, on the very day oi being
appointed Dictator, edocuisset patres plus negligentia caerimonia·
mm auspiciorumque quom temeritate atque inscitia peccatum a C.

Flaminio consule esse Liv. aa. 9. See the extraordinary number of
pia vota conceived‚ caps. 9 and 10, and the still more marvellous
list of prodigies which had occurred previously, cap. 1. .

12. Mssa. The infinitivo is here used, dependent on cecini, after
a successiou oi substantives with participles or adjectives: tropaea
vecto, versos deos, Lares fugantes. So sup. 1. 26 pulsos arces . . .
fluminaque cominus csse.

Jupiter is identified with his temple. ἵ The allusion of course is to
the cackling of the sacred geese when the Gauls were besieging the
Capitol.
