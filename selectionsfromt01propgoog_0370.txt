PROPERTIVS, ΙΙΙ. 7., 65-72; ΙΙΙ. 11.,1-r. 303

buckle on her armour, Prop. 4. 6. aa. Even Horace has not escaped
from the difficulty: were the Egyptian queen so corrupt, so effem-

inate and luxurious, where was the great glory oi overcoming heri ’
Antony's great ability could not be recognised: for the cue given
out both by Caesar and Angustus was that Romans had never
triumphed over Romans. Propertius solves the difficulty in his own
way. He exalts the victory oi Angustus by exalting first the genius
of woman, and by pointing to the master-minda amongst women
who had showed great masculine powers, and exerted empire over
men. The character oi Cleopatra is not spared; she is painted in the
vilest colours; but there is the sense all through that she was a great
woman, that she had been strong enough to conceive direct hopes oi
adding Rome to her domain, and that she had all but suceeeded in
her ambition. He makes us feel that'there was indeed cause toi trem·
bling at Rome during the time when, as Horace puts it Od. 1. 37. 6-8

Capitolio
Regina dementes ruinas
Funus et imperio parabat.

All this is naturally introduced, as from the poet’s own experiences ε
he begins simply, in his usual strain, justifying his devotion to Cyn-
thia: his enslavemcnt to her (cp. l. a addictum rub sua iura virum
to Horace’s corumpatur firminae) is typified and justified by the en-
slavement of men to Medea, to Omphale, to Semiramis, and the all-bnt
enslavement oi the Roman world to Cleopatra The subject grows
naturally out oi his own lise and feeling: and the panegyric on
Angustus is thus introduced more naturally, and with far more power,
than in the more elaborate andofficial description of Actium in 4. 6.

1. versat. The frequentative form oi the verb malres it appro-
priate for expressing violence and passion. Thus in Virg. Aen. 7.
33⁶ Juno declares that Alecto the Fury has power odiis versare
domos (‘ to overturn,’ Machail, but it is rather equivalent to turbare).
Cp. Liv. n. 45. 5 nuuc pudor nunc* iude'guotio versare pectora ,·
Pro ·3·17·‘1² .

p Spesque timorque animum versat utroque toro. .
meam vitam. A Propertian periphrase forme.

2. addictum, ‘made oven’ Addz'cere is said os the judge who
formally makes over any thing or person to a claimant. Addictus
is thus specially used of a debtor handed over as bondsman to his
creditor. Horace has the same idea in a similar connection of Anto-
nius, Emancipatus feminae Epod. 9. ra. So of himself as a free
lance in philosophy, Epp. 1. 1. 14

Nullius addz'ctm iurare in uerbo magistri.
