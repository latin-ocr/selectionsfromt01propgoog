338. NOTES.

Palmer would now read ad nicta, ‘for their wonted rites,’ and com-
pares Appul.
Sc ad rectae sueta conferunt.

54. anuos, i. e. in the Lararium.

56. tul nuum, ‘claims thy place,’ lit· ‘thy funcfion or office:
partem being used for the more usual partes.

57. verbenis. The verbena was a plant much used in sacred
rites oi all kinds, and especially in the ratifying of treaties, as
we leam from Servius on Virg. Aen. 12. 120, Liv. 1. 24, 30.
43 aud elsewhere. It is usually identified with our vervain, but it
was used in a wider sense to denote the leaves or branches of any
sacred tree or bnsh. Thus Servius, quoted above, says Verbena
proprie est barba sacra, ros marium, ut multi volunt, id est tu-
βανωτὶς, sumpta de laco sacro Capitolii qua coronabantur Fetiales
et Pater Patruus foedera facturi vel belia indictuni. Abusive tamen
verbenas' iam vacamus ornnes frondes sacratas, ut est laurus, oliva,
vel myrtus. Terentius (And. 4. 3. 11)‘ ex ara bien sume verberaas'
narn myrtum fuisse Menander testatur, de quo Terentius transtulit.

58. herba Sabina, a kind of juniper, known as savin, used
before incense was known, Ov. Fast. 1. 343

Ara dabas furnos herbis contenta Sabinis,
or as an offering by the poor, Culex 403
Herba turis opes priscis imitata Sabina.

60. Just as a tea-leaf swimming on the top oi a cup of tea is '

called ‘a stranger‚’ so a sputter in the wick oia lamp or candle was
held hythe Romans to herald an arrival, and had to be aelmow-
ledged by a libation. Thus Ov. Her. 19. 151
Sternuit et lumen, posito narn scribimus illa:
Sternuit, et nobis prospera sigim dedit. Ἴ
Ecce! menam nutrix faustos instillat in igms;
Crasque trimus plures, inquit, et ipsa bibit.

We call a fungus-like excrescence on the wick os a candle ‘a
thies! In the passage before us the trine is applied to the lamp.

61, 62. The ‘fatted cali’ would be slain on the wanderer's
return: Hor. Epp. 1. 3. 36

Parcitur in vestrum reditum votiva iuvenca.

62. succincti, ‘gia up for work‚' hence used for ‘active'
‘busy.’ The opposite term, male cinctus, is used osan inactive
luxurious person whose robe is loose; hence ‘profligate' as in the
celebrated warning os Sulla, who detected the ambition ot Caesar
under the foppery and profligacy of his youth: ut rnalc praecimturn
puerum caverent Suet. Caes. 45.
