128 . NOTES.

¹ Tartarus is perfectlydistinct from Erebus ; it is a dark abyss as
far below earth as earth is· below heaven, ll. 8. 173 a brazen auvil,
says Hesiod. Theog. 720, dropped from heaven, would fall for nine
days and nine nights, and on the tenth day would reaeh the earth3
a brazen anvil dropped from earth would fall for nine days and niue
nights, and on the tenth day would reach Tartarus. In this gloomy
dunge0u‚ closed in with gates ofiron, Il. 8. 15, sit Kronus and Iapetus,
11. 8. 479, on whom the sun never shines, and the breeze never blows,
and who, along with the other Titane, rebels against Zeus, are guarded
by Cottns and Gyges, and high-souled Briareus, ΙΙ. 14. 274, 279,
Hes. Theog. 720.

‘Elysium, again, is a happy plain on the western confines of the
earth, cooled by Ocean breezes, where certain favoured men live a
life of hliss. The description in Homer Od. 4. 562 forms part
ol the prophecy delivered by Proteus to Menelaus, and is well known
on account oi its exquisite heauty.

‘let us now hriefly compare these statements with the picture
drawn by Virgil, who, although following in the steps of the great
master, has embellished his descriptione with many particulare de·
rived‚ in part, perhaps, from his own imagination, hut chiefly from
the later Greek poets and philosophare.

1. ‘The rivers Acheron, Styx, Cocytus, Phlegethon, are all in the
nether world. ¹It is not easy to seize the conception formed hy Virgil
of their position and connection, hut it is clear that they formed a
boundary, and that it is necessary that one of them should be crossed
by the spirits of the dead before they can gaiu uoeess to their
destined abode.

a. ‘Theyare transported across hythe grim ferryman Charon, a
personage unknown to Homer, and those only are allowed to pass
who have received the rites of sepulture. These whose bodies re-
main unburied are compelled to wander disconsolate for the term of
a hundred years, a condition unknown to Homer. On the further
side of the streamv is the cave of Cerberus (Homer speaks of the dog
of Hades, and he is named by Hesiod)‚ and beyon'd is a region
tenanted by those who have died a violent death before the hour
appointed by fate.

3. ⁶ Tartarus, at the entrance of which sits the fury Tisiphone, is
a deep gulph which opens out of the realms of Pluto, and is the ι
general place of punishment for the Titane, the Hundredhnnded,

Tantalus, Sisyphus, the Danaids. and all impions men.
’ 4. ‘Elysium is in the lower world, and is the blissful abode of
all the virtnous.
