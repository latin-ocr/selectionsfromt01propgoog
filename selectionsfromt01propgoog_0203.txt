136 NOTES.

l. nentes, ‘while spinning! The ancient idea was that the
FateS, as they span ⁴the thread of each man's destihy at his birth,
chaunted at the same time a song in which the main events of his
life were soretold. Sometimes the prediction was made at the
marriage of the parents, as in the famous case of the marriage os
Peleus and Thetis, Catull. 64, where the fortunes of Achilles are told
to the recurring sabain,
Currite ducentes subtemina, currite fusi.

In Tib. 4. 5. 3 the prophecy is made at the birth,
T e nascente, navum Parcae cecinere puellis

Servitium et dederunt regna superba tibi.
Ovid imitates this passage in Trist. 5. 3. ²5· “ .
2. fflssolueuda. The u is here vocalised asin Cat. 66. 38

Pristina vota nova munere ebssdlsti.

So in l. 74 ivitatem and Hor. Epod. 13. 2 nunc mare, nnnc silzia‘e.

3. Eune perhaps implies that the victory was gained on Mes-
salla's birthday. This supposition¹ removes the harshness of identi-
fying the day and the man.

Aquitanae. 'The limits oi Aquitania are thus defined by

Caesar, Β. G. 1.1 Aquitania a Garumna flumine aa' Pyrenaeos '

mantes et campartem Oceani quae estad Hispaniam pertinet, spectat
inter occasum salis et septemtriones.

4. quem tremeret, ‘at thought of whom the vanquished Atax
should tremble.’ Atax is a river in Gallia Narbonensis, now the
Ande, which flows from the Pyrenees into the Mediterraneum as it
nowhere passes through Aquitania, Scaliger ingeniously conjectured
Ater, for the usual sarm Aturus, the modern Adaur, which flows
into the Bay os Biscay through the ceutre of that province. But the
Atax may well have been the scene of some preliminary victory, as
its valley affords the natural access to Aquitania„

5. Suadere, i. e. the facts soretold by the Fates at their spin-
ning.

pubes Romus, i. e. ‘the manhood os Rome‚’ ‘the Roman
people :’ so Dardana pubes for the Trojans‚ Virg. Aen. 7. 219.

,6. Νο distinction os meaning can be established between
evinctos and vinctas, as though the former were a stronger word. It
is used oi gentle bindings, as by garlands or fillets, Virg. Aen.
5. 494, Ov. Am. 3. 6. 57. Captives were usually represented with
their arms bound behind their backS, but this meaning is not
expressed by evinctas.

7, 8. In allusion to Messalla‘s triumph. The imperf. portabat
is used for graphio effect.
