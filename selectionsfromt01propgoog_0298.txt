23. lum. The lon oi N. has been uuuecessarily changed to
Num by the editors. If num be read, it must be interpreted as said
playiully or ironically, so as to be equivalent in meaning to non or
nonne, just as we might say ‘Is it true then λ’ where the implica·
tion is, ‘ls it not true λ’,

Candidus, a certain correction sor ardalus. Candidus implies
beauty as α whole: candida Dido Virg. Aen. 5. 571. So of Maia,

Lachmann and other editors, followed by Paley, believe that this
ν Elegy marks the commenoement oi a new book. The poem reads

has determined to give up the writing oi love verses, and to betalre
himself henceforth to singing os wars and warlike deeds, or, in other
words, to add one more to the panegyrista of Augustus. In his own
simple words, l. 6
Bella canam quando scn'pta puella mea est.

Unfortunately the promise is not sulfilled; ior, as Postgate observes,
there is but one poem in the book (a. 31 according to the usual
nurhberiug, on the dedication oi the Temple of Apollo), which
specially relates to Augustus, and that poem was obviously written,
as it purports to be, with quite a different motive. Lachmann's theory
quite breaks down; it is not supported by any evidence to show
that a common purpose can be traced running through any oue oi
the books oi our poet; it is opposed by the authority of the MSS,
and it assigns to the second book a bulk so small—nine poems in all
-as to be out os all proportion with the length oi the remaining
