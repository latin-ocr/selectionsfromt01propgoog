33. I.e. ‘ Here there are no frantie Bacchanalian orgies.’ Pen-
theus, king of Cadmus, being opposed to the worship of Dionysus,
was hunted as a vvild beast by his mother Agave, and two Maenads,
aud torn in pieces. Pentheus had climbed into a tree for the pur-
pose of spying out their secrets.

34 Le. ‘Here uo Iphigenia was ever sacrificed!

35. Io was turned by the jealous Juno into a cow.

cornua curvare, ‘to cause crumpled horus to grove) This
phrase supports the conjecture of curvate in 3. 7. ²9·

36. bove, i. e. ‘the form of a cow.’

37. Sinis of Corinth' ‘made trees into gibbets,' by fastening his
victims to the tops of two pinetrees bent together, and then letting
them spring apert, Ι

37, 38. The accusatives of this couplet are govemed by some
verbal idea to be supplied from the previous passage.

38. Saxa, supposed to be the Scironian rocks, on the ooast of
Megaris, where there was only a narrow path left between the rocks
and thesea. But as in suafata refers again to Sinis, who was hoist

42. aptus. Here used for ‘ suitable,' ‘proper' This use con·
firms the reading apta 3. 5. 18, where there is. the same confusion as
here in the MSS. between apta and acta. We see from this line that
Tullus was not yet married.

Tffls piece is in the style ol the Heroides of Ovid. It is an
imaginary letter written by a young wife from Rome to her husband,
who has been absent for four years on a campaign with Augustus in
the East. The names Arethusa and Lycotas are poetical and fic-
titious: but it has been supposed that they are intended to designate
Propertius’ friend Postumus and his wife Aelia Galla. For this
there is no further evidence than that afforded hythe charming poem
3. 12, in which Propertius writes a somewhat similar letter to his
friend Postumus, upbraiding him for being able to stay away so long
from his wife Galla, while waning in the East, and assuring him
of her matchless constancy. The conditions are similar, and it is
very possible that the circumstances of Postumus and Galla may
