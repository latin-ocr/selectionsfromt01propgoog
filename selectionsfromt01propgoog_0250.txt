TJBULLUS‚ 111. 3, 33-5.,1-1a. 183

general, like the word ‘Spa2' ‘greatest amongst hot springs, on account
oi its holy waters' But no prooi of such a use has been adduced, to
say nothingoi the intolerable ambiguity which it would introduce
here. Others wrest maxim into the sense os maior, meaning ‘su-
perior' This is no less inadmissible. It has been noted that autern
is not elsewhere used by Tibullus. The words reteximus and praxi-
mus are not unfrequeutly interchanged in MSS.

'4 aa remittit, ‘unbends irom,' ‘is released,’ i. e. from the cold
of winter. Ov.Fast.4.126

Vere nitent terrae. vere remissus ager.

The winter is regarded as presenting au interruption to the normal

state nithe earth.

purpureo vena, ‘under the influence oi spring?

5. mnam contrasted, asD. points out, with purpurea 1. 4. For
negra lrara cp. niger a'e'es Prop. a. 24. 34.

denuntiet. This verb is osten used in the sense oi threatening:
inimicitias, caedem, vim denuntiare, etc. occur in Cicero.

8. nudandae deae. , The Bona Dea, to whose rites no male
might be admitted. Tib. 1. 6. 22

Sacra bonae alaribus nan adeunda Deae.

It is well known what serious consequences, political aud personal,
were entailed by the violation os these rites by Clodius in Caesar's
housgnfflit pocula, ‘drugged a bowl’ W. R.

10. trita, ‘pounded' A. has certa. T rita venena occurs also
prop¹11².¹ lalliaco· is not quite sowell supported as sacrilegi, but it
gives a better sense. And ii sacrilegi would readily be changed to
sacrilegas to agree with ignes (Pinder), sacrilegas might still more
readily be changed to sacrilegi to agree with nas.

13. turm monus. Lachmann illustrates by this phrase the ·

iurgia saevitiae of Prop. 1. 3. 18. ‘Brunding over the resentments
oi a irenzied mind’ Pinder.

18. This line occurs in Ovid’s autobiography, Trist. 410. 6,
and it is extremely unlikely that Tibullus would have borrowed so
marked a line literally, and without acknowledgment. Further, it is
certain that he was bom at least eleven years, probably sixteen years,
’ before the event indicated, which took place Β. e. 43. See Intro-
duction. Either, therefore, these lines are interpolated, or else the
author was not the poet Tibullus. As a mutter oi fact, the lines are
quite out os place where they stand.
