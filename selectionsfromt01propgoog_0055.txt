xlviii INTRODUCTION

endings other than the dissyllabic, and that his verse was
gradually confonning to the precise laws which became
perfect and stereotyped in the verse of Ovid. lt is
evident that the whole of the poems of Book IV were
written during the latest period of his art, and that it is
impossible to refer any of them to the earlier period
when he systematically revelled in the use of the longer
endings. Some valuable observations on the metre of Pro-
pertius will be found in Mr. Postgate's lntrod, p. cxxvi.
One more question has been started: was the rupture
with Cynthia which took place in Β. c. 23 absolutely final?
We know that she did not long survive the rupture: was
the old intimacy ever renewed before her death? One
poem only, 4. 7, alludes to the death of Cynthia. This
poem represents a dream in which the spirit of Cynthia
appears to Propertius aiter death, rebukes him for for-
getting their love so soon, and reproaches him with not
having been present to conduct the ceremonies of. her
funeral. She then proceeds to give the poet various
instructions. Mr. Postgate (Introduction, p. xxv) has
made a most interesting analysis of this poem. He holds
it to prove that the lovers had been once more reconciled,
that she had died leaving to Propertius the disposal of ,
her effects, that in the prostration of grief he had neglected
all the ‘death dunes‚’ and that he wrote this poem as an
expressiones contrition. His interpretation is fair and
ingenious·; but it would unnecessarily lower Propertius
in our estimation. If the quarrel was never made
up, and she died while they were still estranged, it was
quite natural that he should take no part in her obsequies,
and the other arrangements connected with her death.
But tovsuppose that they were friends at the time of her
death, and that he proved utterly neglectful of the com-
monest offices of friendship to her remains, nay even
outraged his former love by conduct showing blank in-
difference to her memory, is to suppose that he had lost
