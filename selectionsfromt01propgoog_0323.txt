· 256 NOTESi

those of Latona and Diana. Ll. 7, 8 give a very feeble ending to
the poem. But, besides this, it is possible that two distinct statues
oi the god may be referred to. Pliny speaks os a colossal statue
oi the Tuscan Apollo, in broune, placed inside the library, and there
may have been one in marble in the exterior colonnade. Ii so,
tacita lyra, and in longo carmina veste sonat, may be characteristic
descriptions oi the two statues: in the one the lyre was only held in
the hand, in the other the god was represented as playing upon it.
Hic equidem'defines the position oi the statue first named, as being
in the outer colonnade, near the Dunaids.

(followed by Postgate) reads Et duo, pointing out that there were
two subjecte, one on each side of the fastigium.

12. The solding doors were oi ivory; on one panel was
carved e gronp of Ganls being hurled down from the roek at Delphi
by the god, on the other the slaying ol Niobe's children. This refers
to the attack of the Gauls on Delphi in the irruption oi Β. c. 279.

14. funera, ‘the tragic calamity;’ or possibly‘the dead children·

nantelmus. Niobe was daughter oi Tantalus.

15. The repetition os inter, as Postgate points out, gives im·
portance to the two goddesses as making us think separately oi
each. See note on 3. 18, 21 and Hor. Sat. 1. 7. 11,12.

16. in longa veste, i. e. the long-trailing robe (pallo) of the
