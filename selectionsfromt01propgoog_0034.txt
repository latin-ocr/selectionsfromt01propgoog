TO TIBULLUS. · xxvii

i.e. he gives to Tibullus the palm lor grace and polish,
though some would assign it to Propertius: Ovid is more
free, Gallus is deficient in tenderness. But the most beau-
tiful tribute to his meritis the Elegy of Ovid, Am. 3. 9, of
which mention has been already made. It is too long to
transcribe as a whole, but here are the concluding lines :

Si tamen e nobis aliquid nio nomen et umbra
Restat, iu Elysia valle Tibullus erit,

-Obuius huie ventas, hedera iuvenilia cinctus
T empore, cum Calvo, docte Catulle, tuo,·

Tu quoque, si salsum est temerati crimen amici,
Sanguinis atqree animae prodige, Galle, tuae.

His comes umbro tuo est. Si quo est niodo corporis umbra,
Auxisti numeros, culte Tibulle, pios:

Ossa quieta, precor, tuto requiescite in urna,
Et sit brimus cineri nou onerosa tuo.

These lines have been thus gracesully rendered by
Professor N ichol ¹ :

Ati l yet, ifauy port os us remeius
But nante and sbadow, Albius is not dead ;
Δ And thou, Catullus, in Elysiau plains
Witb Calvus see tle iuy croton leis bead.
Thou, Gallus, prodigal os lise and blood,
If false tlte charge of amity betrayed,
And ought remeius across tlte Stygiae stood,
Sbalt meet brim youder witb thy happy sbade.
Refiuea' Tibullus! thou art joined to tleose
Liuing iu calm comuueuion we'tb tle blest ;
Iu peaceful um thy quiet boues repese-
May earth lie ligltly ubere tby ashes rest!
