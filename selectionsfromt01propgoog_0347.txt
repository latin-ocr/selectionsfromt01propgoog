280 NOTES.

Rome as a province. Thus veniet is stronger thanfiet‚ as if the East
came voluntarily to place herself under Roman protection. The
same idea is'implied in fluent.

5. virgis, in allusion to the fasces. It may be a dative of
possession, or possibly an ablative of description.

6. rartba for Parthica: see note on 3. a. 11.
’ ’1. prorae is the vocative: so equi in the next line.

expertae bello, in allusion to Augustus’ naval victories:
first, that gained over Sextus Pompeius by Agrippa in Sicily B. c. 36,
and, more notably‚ the battle of Actium in s. c. 31· v

aare mssa, ‘spread your sails' Dare is frequently thus
used with an accusative in such a way that the phrase is equivalent to
an intransitive verb. Thus anr. a. 1¹43 says that one day the
walls of the world

Expugnata dabunt labem putrisque ruinas,
which simply means, ‘will fall in crumbling ruins) So dat
sonitum, properly ‘canses a sound,' is equivalent to ‘ resounds! See
Muuro on Lucr. lc. In other passages dara with a predicative
adjective is equivalent to a transitive verb: as Virg. Aen. 9. 3²3
Haec ega vasta dabo.

8. ducite munus. It is quite out of place to refer these
words to the Equites equa publica or the Equitum recognitio,
a ceremony long disused with a view to actual warfare‚ and only
partially restored for mere form's sake (Suet. Oct. 38) by Augustus.
The phrase is aconfused expression ; duceie is appropriate to barses,
‘lead forth,’ or ‘draw ;’ munus, ‘'function,’ would imply some such
word as ‘perform’ before it. As it stands, therefore, the phrase will
cover any work to be done by horses: armigeri confines it to the
cavalry. '

9. ahta, ‘avenge' Piara is a transitive verb, used iu the
widest possible sense to denote 'any act of religious duty in re-

’ ference to the thing or person which stands as its object. Of a

god, ‘to appease' or ‘worship’ as Hor. Ep. a. 1. 143 Silvanum
lacte piabant ,· of an altar, Prop. 3.10.19 ubi turc piaveris aras,
‘phast ‹suly honoured3' of a bad omen, ‘to avert its¹evil con·
sequences,' Virg. Aen. a. 1843 of a crime, ‘to expiate it,’ ‘wipe it
out,’ ib. 140. Here the idea is ⁸ to avenge :' ‘wipe out the impiety
of leaving the Crassi and their slaughter unavenged.'

11. lumina. Rarely used, as here, of a fire.

12. illa, correctly, of a distant, uncertain day: elsewhere, as we·
have seen, Propertius uses hic in the same sense.

13. oneratos axes, the reading of the MSS, is perhaps better
