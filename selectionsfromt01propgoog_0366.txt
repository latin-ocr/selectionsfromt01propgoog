storms, but thathe was not conscious either oi the comforts he was
enjoying, or of the hardships he was about to iace.

49. mio. So Hertz.: the MSS. have ctio. θύα or θυία was
the Greek name oi the citrus tree (Tisaia articulata), to which
the Romans attached extraordinary value sor liurposes of iur-
niture. Persius speaks oi luxurious couches being made oi this
wood, 1. 53.

musmo is probably the bed made oi cirrus wood, though it
might be taken of the chamber itself, iumished or pauelled with
that wood.

oraora mrebiutho seems either to have suggested, or to have
been copied from, Virg. Aen. 10. 136, oi ivory set in a irame,

Inclusum buxo aut Oricia terebintho.
The terebinthus is our turpentine tree. Pliny describes the wood as
plicat, durable, et nigri splendoris, Η. Ν. 13. 12, aud says cups weie
vturned out oi it. He includes both the citrus and the terebinthus
among the woods suitable for veneering purposes, the others being
box, palm, holly, ilex and elder-root (16. 84). · '

Oricia from Oricum or Oriens, in illyria, the port of em-
barkation ior Brundusium. See 1. 8. ao, where Postgate says it was
‘famous ior box and turpentine wood.’ What is the authority ior
this statement? Pliny says that the tree grew to a great size in Syria,
but that there was a small shrubby variety which grew on Mount
Ida in the Troad, and in Macedonia, 13. 12, while in 16. 30 he says
that, like the cedar and larch, it loves the mountaius. In all pro·
bability the terebinti was called Orycian, merely because Oryeus was
the port of shipping, just as all Eastern wares were called Syrien,
as Slnny derives its name from Xeres, and Hamburg Sirerry from
the port of Hamburg.

50. Effultum or Est tutum, an undoubted correction sor
Et fultum. It is hard to choose between the two: but effultus is
twice used by Virgil.

versicolore pluma is difficult. We can scarcely doubt that ,
cushions, ceruicalia, are alluded to, as by Martial 12. 17. 8

Dormit et in pluma purpureoque toro.
But if the cushions are only stnfied with seathers, why versicolore?
Becker, Gallus p. 288-9, makes out that the plumarii exercised an
art of embroidery with seathers, making ‘seather tapestry.’ This
may be so: but Mart. 14. 146 applies the terms cervical and pluma
to the same obJect‚ and pluma versicolor might well stand for
‘a parti-coloured seather·cushion,' pluma denoting the contenta,

. versicolor the omamentation of the case. Versiculor, as Postgate
