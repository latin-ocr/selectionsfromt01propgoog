PROPERTJUS,111. aa, 10-23. 327 '

Palmer’s conjecture Etsi quei rigui is commended by the inge-
nuity of his explanation: ‘the ui os rigui was dropped before the
ui of visenda, and the scribe built up the remaining m'g into origaa'
But what did the scribe take arigae to mean? F urther¹ to bring in
travellers in general (si quoe) is scarcely in harmony with the spirit
of the passage which is addressed to Tullus alone (tu . . . tuque
tuo . . . ipse legas).

16. One editor imagines the Rhesus in the Troad to be intended;
another the Ganges! But the seven-mouthed river can be none
other than the Nile; cp. Cat. 11. 7

Sive quae septemgeminus colorat
Aequora Nilus,
and Ov. Met. 15. 753
. Perque papymferi septemflua flumina Nili.

Temperare means to ‘mix in due proportion,' hence ‘to mode-

rate' Propertius here means that the force or volume of the water is

lessened by being divided into seven channels: he expresses this by s
, saying ‘the water moderates its seven channels.' Cp. Virg. Geo.

1. 110, of water scatebrisque arentia temperat arva, i. e. ‘moderates
the dryness of the fields.' Closely parallel is temperat ira manus
l. 22. There is no ‘mixing‘ in the case, as Hertz. supposes: Nilus
denua sempe( per vias suas effunditur, novasque aquas prioribus
addit, et has mis miscet.

17. ‘Will yield to the Roman land,’ i. e. ‘to the marvels of the
Roman land! So Juv, 3. 74 semna Promptus et Isaeo torrentior,where
‘more rushing than Isaeus ⁹ =‘than the eloquence of Isaeus.'

18. imitated by Ov. A. A. 1. 56.

19. As Pinder observes, the best commentary on these lines is
Virg. Aen. 6. 854

Parcere devictis et debellare superbas.
But it is clear from ll. 27-38 that the words commoda nexae refer to
more than Roman mercy. Propertius had the passage in Geo. 2
closely in view: the genial temperate climate, free srom extremes,
the absence of noxious beasts, fierce animals, serpents, monsterS, and
monstrous crimes, are all referred to in declaring Italy to be not
commoda noxae. '

samanar. Just as in 1. 16, the river itself, which supplies the
force of water, is said to moderate its courses‚ so here the rage which
nerves the arm is said to moderate it when it declines to put forth
its full strength.
