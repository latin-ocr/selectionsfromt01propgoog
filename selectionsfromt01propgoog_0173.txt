106 NOTES.

attachment to his patron (ll. 25-34); but whereas Tibullus refuses
an invitation to accompany Messalla, Horace volunteers unsolicited,
aud apparently against remonstrance, to follow Maecenas through
every danger to the extremities of the earth. As a matter of fact,
Horace enjoyed at home the peace and comfort for which Tibullus

sighed: but whether his abstention was due to accident or policy‚ Ι
his Muse has not betrayed him. ·

At the time supposed, if Tibullus was bom in nc. 59, he would
have arrived at the age of 28. His term of ten years‘ service as
an eques would have expired; and the contemplative indolent poet
was little disposed to embark again on the troubled waters from
which he had just emerged. ᾖ

l. The conditions of modern warfare make it hard for us to
realise that over the greater part of human history, whether
ancient or modern, the chief attraction in the military profession
has been the hope of enrichment. The profession of arms, now,
emphatically the ‘poor man’s' profession, has been mainly filled
hymen anxious to make their fortunes, whether on a big or little
scale. The Celtic races have never known but two motives to
war—piunder and revenge. The Scottish Celt was able to live
up to his principles till put down by the strong arm of England
in the middle of last century. At Rome, until the Emperors in·
troduced a stable and tolerably just government throughout the
provinces, Roman soldiers, whether generals or legionaries, came
home gorged with plunder. When legitimate plunder failed, as
during the Civil Wars, honest citizens had to be despoiled of their
lands to satisfy the demands of the soldiery; and the triumvirs
swelled their legions by promising grants of lands to their ad-
herents, just as Cromweil did to the army which he took over to
Ireland in '1⁶49-

Dtvtttaa, as defined by auro, refers to the former mode of pay-
ment: iugera malta soli to the latter. When Horace hears that
his friend Iccius is going to join the expedition of Aelius Gallus
against Arabia, he takes it as a matter of course that thirst sor gold .
is his motive, od. 1. 29. r '

Icci beatis nunc Arabum incides
Garis? ’

Similarly, Propertius prophesies great wealth to those who join
Augustns’ expedition to the East, 3. 4. 3 Magna, viri, rmrces
and (like Tibullus) excuses himself from joining it because he has
no thirst eiffler for gold or gems or land, 3. 5. 3-8
