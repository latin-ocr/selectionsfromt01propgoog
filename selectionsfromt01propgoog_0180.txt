calves and lambs3 the Lares Compitales, worshipped at the spot
· where two or more roads crossed each other; the Lares Vr'ales,
probably the same with the preceding, sc called because their images
, were erected in streets aad highways: invoked by travellers when
,setting forth on a journey (see Plaut. Merc. 5. a. 23); the Lares
Virorum,01 guardians oi the streets ; the Lares Praestites, protectore
of the city; the Lares Permarine', worshipped by rnariners (a
temple was dedicated to them in the Campus Martius, ac, 179); and
the Lares Grundnles, who stood under the grundae or projeeting
caves of houses.

‘It is obvious iram what has been said that the Roman Lares bear

. a marked resemblance to the saints os the Roman Catholic Chnreh.

Like them, the saints are believed to be the spirits oi dead men, to
' whose protection cities, streets‚ roads, ships, semilies, and private

. individuals are commended ; statues or pictores os saints are to be

found in streets‚ crossways, bridges, ships, dwelling-houses, and all
places oi public and private resort; these are honoured with gar·
lands and offerings os every description, while lamps fed with per- ,
fnmed oil burn before their shrines. The Lares must be dis·
tinguished from the Penates. The word Penates is apparentlya local
adjective like nostras, cuias, Casinas, Arpinas, etc, connected with
penitus, penetra, penetralia, etc, so that the term properly denotes
the deities worshipped in the penns¹ or innermost part of the house.
But we have already seen that the ferens or hearth situated in the
. Atrium was considered the central point oi the dwelling, and was
invested with peculiar sanetity. Hence Penates is infacta generic
term, and, in its strict sense, comprehends all tle gods worshipped at
tae Ιιιανίῆ, and will thus include the Lares, who are continually
mentioned in conjunctior with the Penates, and frequently in such
terms as to imply that they were the same. But it is quite certain
that other gods, besides the Lares, were worshipped at the hearth,
especially Vesta, 'who was herself the Goddess os the Hearth, and to
these the term Penates is often applied, so as to distinguish them stom
the Lares. This is evident from a single passage in Plautus, Mero.
5·1·s ,

Dr' Penates menne parentum, familiaeque Lar pater,

Vobis manda meum parentum rem bene ret testemini.

Ego mihi alies Deos Penates persequar, alium Larem.
It would be vain to enquire who the Penates were, since they might
