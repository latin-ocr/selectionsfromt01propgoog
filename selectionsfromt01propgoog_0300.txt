9. subducto seems to refer, as Postgate explains, to the ‘draw-
ing up‘ of the iace o'r eyebrows as a mark of austerity. Thus
Gell. 19. 7. 16 Vituperoncs suos subducti supercilii carptores appel·
lavit. The other meaning oi subductus, ‘withdrawn,' ‘retired,’ is
not appropriate.

10. mam, ‘another and a new lyre,’ i. e. a more dignified .
strain.

11. As the reading stands, anima, carmina, Pierides, are all
vocatives: ex humili goes closely with surge, and is exactly
parallel to Hor. Od. 3. 30, 12

Deduxisse modos,
where the meaning is ‘rising to lordly greatness out ola humble
lot.' Paley retains carmine, the reading oi N., and follows those
editors who punctuate thus:

Surge, anima, ex humili iam camina sumite vires.

12. magni oris opus, ‘ a grandiloqnent‚ big-mouthed, work’

sponting and declamation. Hence it is used here and elsewhere to
denote the more high-down langnage os Epic poetry.

13. The one terrible and as yet unavenged deleat which the

Δ Roman arms had sustained at the hand os a foreign soe was the

fatal field oi Carrhae, tae. 53, when Crassus and his son were
slain and the whole Roman army destroyed or captured by the
Parthians. Hence the Parthian name became a name of terror and
shame to the Romans. Caesar was about to set out on a Parthian
campaign when he was assassinated3 and it was the great ambition
of Augustus' lile to wipe out the disgraoe oi Carrhae. This he
eflected by diplomacy and a display ot sorce in nc. 20, when, taking
advantage os the internal dissensions of the Parthians, he obtained

¹ the restoration os the standards lost with Crassus at Carrhae,

received the homage os the king Phraates, and placed Tigranes
upon the throne of Armenia. This event was regarded as the
