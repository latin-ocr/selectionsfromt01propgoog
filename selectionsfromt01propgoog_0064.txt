will confirm these conclusions, and show that while
paramount importance is to be attached to Ν., the
readings of 1⁸³². and Ψ. are extremely valuable, while
the agreement of the three, as M. Plessis says, amounts
to a certainty. The important reading natat, 3. 7. 22,
comes from F².

ln this edition the sign Ο. is used, as by Baehrens, but
in a slightly different sense. Baehrens uses it to denote
his supposed archetype, the readings of which are to be
ga'thered from a consensus either of all the MSS. or of

'what he regards as the good MSS, viz. A. D. F. V. in

opposition to N. F ². Ψ. In this edition Ο. is used to
signify the consensus of these same MSS, but without
reference to the archetype theory, and to the exclusion of
Ν., the readings os which are stated separately. Baehrens’
Ο. includes N .‚ except when the contrary is stated 3 and as
he does not attach much importance to N ., he has been
less particular in recording its readings.

The Editio Pn'nceps of Propertius appeared at Venice
in 1472, and from that day to this new editions have been
poured forth ina continuous stream. The most important
are those of Muretus (1 5 58), of Scaliger (1577), who con·
fused the text by endless and arbitrary transpositions, of
Dousa (ι 588), of Passerat (1608 i), containing a perfect
storehouse of illustrations, of G. Barth (1777), of Bur·
mann (1780), and the somewhat lumbersome edition of
Kinnoel (1805). Tm first great step to the purification
of the text was made by Lachmann in his first edition of
1816: he was the first to distinguish the comparative
value of the leading MSS, in the main correctly: but he
has been the author of infinite confusion by re·arranging
many of the poems, and by introducing on arbitrary=
grounds the division into five books against the authority
of the MSS. In 1829 he published a second edition, in
which, without explanation, he gave up almost all the

conjectures of his first edition. The references to Lach- ’
