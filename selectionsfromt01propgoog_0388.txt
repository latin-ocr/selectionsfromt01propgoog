PROPERTJUS, 111.18.,1a72a 321

1. 8· ²⁵ licet Autariah considat in oras

. Et licet Hylleis ; ,
and again 1. 8. 37 .
Quamvis magna daret, quamvis maiora daturus:

and 2. ³litigat inter matrem deus ipse interque sororem.

If we keep scd we may explain it as either (r) in reference to omncs .·
‘why spealr of the rich? Death awaits alt· rich and poor alike ;'
or (2) as a repetition and eniorcement of the idea contained in
ignibus or dabis: ‘you may have all wealth‚ bat all will go to the
flames, but all alike end in death! Hoc has been changed to huc
in consequence oi the huc later in the line, otherwise a verb of rest
(agimus or facimus) would have to be supplied with hoc, a verb oi
motion with lauc, the awkwardness of which was intolerable. The
repetition oi sad, l. aa, is another argument against sed in l. 21.

primus et ultimus ordo, in allusion to the well-known sour-
teen iront rows reserved sor equites by the law of Otho.

22. mua, a strong word, expressing abhorrence. Male sit is
¹alregula'r form of curse, and we may almost translate here ‘ac-
cursed.'

24. publica. There is no distinction oi rank or classes among
Charon's passengers: the primus et ultimus ordo, the ‘classes3 and
the ‘messes' all huddle together.

25. rue. He passes from Marcellus and the person whom he

hasbeen addressing, ll. 17-a4‚ to the representative oi man in ,

geueral. Perhaps ille may bear the sense of ‘your famous captain '
(Pmffio refers probably to the coat oi mail, greaves‚ ete.; aare to
the hglgertirotrahdt, i. e. drags him out of his protecting armour, as
though he had secured himself in a sortress. ¹

caput, by the series of steps illustrated on a. 1. 36, comes to mean
as here ‘the body’ rather than ‘the liie’ (Postgate), which is too
abstract an idea for this passage.

With these lines cp. Dunbar, Lament ior the Makkaris:

He tates tte champion in the staur,
Τ lie captain closdd ia the taur,

The lady in bower full of beauty ,ᾗ
Τ imur mortis conturbat mc.

Herriclr also says,
There is no armour against Fata. ’
