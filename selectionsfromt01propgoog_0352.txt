PROPERTIUS, 111. 5., 7-22. 285

end with s ; inferna was changed to infimas, either because rates
had been changed first, or because s follows at the beginning of
stultc; in was dropped out, as Paley suggests, because it recnrs in ·
i,·nferna and lastly, when the omission was discovered, ad, as the
most likely preposition, was inserted.
Indus. Cp. Job 1. 21 Naked came I cut af my motier's wanti,
and nakcd shall I return thither. So 1 Tim 6. 7.
15. miscebitur. Miscea here, as usual, means an indiscriminate'
mingling, wrthout regard to lnnd or quantity in opposition t,otcmpcro
.which mearis ‘to mingle rn due proportion' Cp. Haec ita mixta
suerunt ut temperata uullafucrint modo Cic Rep. a. 23. 42.
16. σοιιιιιΙο. Jugurtha was captured' rn the year succeeding
' Marius' first consulship, in rac. 106; but Marius entered the city in
triumph upon the second day of his second consulship, Jan. 2, ,
me. 104.

17. The Croesus of Lydia is contrasted with Irus, the greedy
beggar of the Odyssey (18. x5, etc), to represent the extremes of
wealtb and poverty.

18. A corrupt line, which no one has succeeded in emending or
interpreting satisfactorily. -The MSS. read parta, which is senseless,
or parca. Bae. conjectares carpta, retaining apta before die. Lach.
conjectures parcae, comparing Virg. Aen. 12. 150 Parcarumque dics,
of a natural death; but the singular in this sense is unexampled.
Other conjectures are tarda and (equally good) propera. N. has
apta before Δίες Hertz. and Lach. read acta comparing 3. 7. 30,
which is scarcely in point. When H. is reduced to interpreting parca
dies as ‘a day which spares the life, i. e. puts off death, as long as
possible‚’ and Paley as ‘a day, or time, of poverty‚' it is useless to
consult commentators further. If we read, as in the text, acta quac
venit apta dic, we at least have sense: ‘That death is best which
comes at its own fit time, when one's day is done?

21. 10 ravat reminds us of the refrain Hor. Od. 1. r. 3 sqq. “

Sunt quos . . . iuvat, etc.

’ coluisse and implicuisse 1. ao, alongside of vincire l. 21,
show that no distinction can be drawn between the present and
perfect infinitive. Pers. is fond 'of the same usage ς cp. a. 66

Haec baccam conchae rasisse, ct stringere venas.
moire. The phrase is borrowed from the idea of chaplets:
seenextline.
22. caput habere tn rosa. ‘To have one's head crowned
with roses,’ i. e. ‘to carouse.’ So Cic. has in rosa potare Fin. 2. 20.
65 ; Sen. in rosa iacere Ep. 56. 9.
