PROPERTIUS, 1v. 3., 2-10. 331

oi long streaks or trails oi flama. So Luc. 10. 256 has lorrgo mitescere
tractu of the long course oi the Nile.

¹1. modo, ‘lately.'

iteratos . . . per ortua,=‘ior many and many a day past-¹
The orcus are the risings oi the sun.

iteratos means repeated, not ior a second time only, but over
and over again, so that it=multos. Palmer quotes Ov. Fast. 6. 199
ior Phoebusque iteraverit artus: but the first part oi that line
Mane ubi bis fuerit shows that a second repetition only is meant.
In 4. 1. 82 sagara iterata ratae arethe signs oi the zodiac, ‘scanned
again and again’ by astrologers; and in Stat. silv. 1. 2. 84 iterata
vulnerasse wounds ‘repeated again aud again? Schultze supposes
Lycotas to be compared to a star ‘rising day after day' over Bactra.

8. Ιοιιτίοιιι. The reading is uncertain: the text is a con·
jecture os Jacob, adopted by most editors, ior' the hericus oi the best
MSS. The Neuri were a Sarmatian tribe mentioned by Val. Flac.
6. 122 et raptor agrorum Neunes, and by other authors, while
the Sarmaticus were specially noted lor their heavy mail-clad horse·
men. See Tac. Hist. 1. 79, where the cavalry of another Sarmatian
tribe, the Roxolani, are described. They were so heavily armed
that once fallen, like the knights in the Middle Ages, they could not
rise. Between 13. e. 30 and 2ο operationshad been undertaken against
the Daci and other tribes beyond the Danube, to which Horace oiteu
resers, and which would make an allusion to any Sarmatian tribe—
as to the Getae in l. 9-quite natural. The conjecture Sericus is
not improbable. The Seres, of whom the Romans knew little or
nothing, are spoken os in three places by Horace as an extreme
Easteru tribe within reach oi the power ol Rome, Od. r. 12. 56,
3. ²9· 27, 4. 15. 233 and it is remarkable that in the parallel poem
to Postumus, Propertius speaks oi the Median (i. e. Parthian) arrows
and the mailed horsemen in one breath, 3. rr. 11

Neve tua Medae laetentur caede sagittae,
Ferreus aurata neu cataphractus equo.

10. decolor. There can be little doubt that decolor is the right
reading, rather than the discolor of the MSS. T he prepositions di and
de are perpetually interchanged in MSS. Manto, Jonmal ol Phil,
vol 6. p. 62 , points out that discolor is read ior decolor hyan equal
number of MSS. in each oi the six places iu Ovid where decolor
occurs. Ovid uses the word specially of India and the Indians:
aud Seneca also has India decolor, Hippolytus 345. Mauro holds,
without sufficient reason, that an aqua cannot mean ‘on the
Eastern ware or waters,' asan ablativa of place. He shows that
