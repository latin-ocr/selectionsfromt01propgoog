TIBULLUS,' 1. 7., 1-12. 137

9. We thus see that Tibullus accompanied Messalla in the
campaign. The Tarbelli are named by Plin. N. H. 4. 19amongst the
Aquitanian tribes. Their country, id. 30, 2, was celebrated sor its
hot and cold springs. They lived on the Aturus, andare mcu-
tioned by Lucan and other authors as living on that stream,

Qui tenet, et ritas Aturi, qua litore curvo
Molliter admissum claudit Tarbellicus aequor,
Signa nervil, gaudetque amolo Santonus hoste.

Ausonius speaks of Tarbellicus cllum, and the tribe has given its
name to the modern Tarbes.

10. The Santones dwelt to the N. of the Garonne, giving their
name to the medem province Santoigne.

11. Arar. The Arar is the modern Saone, a river which flows
into the Rhone with a course dne Southwards at Lyons, and hes its
origin on the S. slopes of the Vosges mountains, not far from the
sources of the Mense and the Moselle, which, rising on the Northern
side nithe same chain, flow Northwards towards the Rhine and the
Atlantic. Geographically speaking, the valley ol the Saone is, in
fa'ct, the continuation, or·rather the commencement‚ of the great
Rhene valley, so that the Rhone ought rather to be considered the
tributary ol the Saone. than the Saone the tributary oi the Rhone. Ι
But with rivers, as with notioris, might osten triumphs over right:
and the superior volume oi the Rhone‚ fed by the snows of Switzerss
land, has enabled it to usurp the title which belonged by right to the
placid Gallie stream. Caesar thus describes the Saone: Flumen
est Arar, qnod perfines Aeduorum et Sequanorum in Rhodanum
fluit incredibili lenitate, ita nt aculis, in utram partem fluat, iudi·
cari nonpossit B. G. 1. 12.

12. canusia. So M.: bnt A. has Cornan. Caesar calls the
people Carnutes: bnt as the Greek form is Kapvoirror, the Latin
lorm should be Carnutes, not as here Corneliis. This people
in Caesar's time occupied the country to the W. os the upper Seine,
upon both banks ol the Loire. They give their name to the province
called Cbartrain, and to the modern town of Clrartres (Autricum).
lt isto be noted thatin this and other cases, the name of modern
French towns is derived not srom the Roman name ot' the ancient
city on the same site, but stom that ol the Gallie tribe which
occupied the surrounding country. Thus Paris derives its name from
the Parisii, not srom Lutetia ; Bourgcs from the Bituriges, not
from Avaricum,- Tauri, not lrom Augustodunum, but from the
