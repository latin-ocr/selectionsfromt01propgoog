TIBULLUS, II. 5., 95-1L 6., 1-3. '177

II. 6.

THE poet Aemilius Macer had gone forth to the wars; taking
contage from his example, and distracted hythe cruelties and caprice
ol his beloved Nemesis, Tibullus determines to buckle on his armour
and to cure himself of his love by absence. But alas! the very
thought of leaving Nemesis behind unmaus him: once more he turns
and implores her to take pity on him. Hope will not desert him:
he implores her by the memory of her sister, who had died hya
tragic and untimely death, to heal his wounds and restore him to
her favour.

1. uacet. We have to distinguish between two contempora-
neous poets oi the same name.

(ι) Aemilius Macer oi Verona, who according to the Eusebiae
chronicle died in Asiane. 16. He was apparently a friend of
Virgil, sor Serv. ap. E. 5 says that by Mopsus intelligitur Aemilius
Macer Veronensis poeta, amicus Vergili. He wrote a poem on
birds, snakes, and plants, aa appears lrom Ov. Trist. 4. 10. 43

Saepe secas volucres legit milei grandior aevo
Quaeque necet serpens, quac iuvet herba, Macer.
Manilius alludes to this pbem Astr. a. 43 in similar terms. Quin-
tilian contrasts him with Lucretius, whom he terms difficilis, while
Macer is humilis, both being elegantes in seca materia. Ι

(a) The Macer addressed by Ovid in Am. a. 18 and in E. P.
a. 10. 15, and therefore alive in nc. 12. Ovid speaks os him as an
old eompanion, and thus describes his poetry:

Tu conis aeterno quidquid restabat lamera,
Ne careant summa Τ roe'ca bella manu.
In E. P.4. 16. 6 he calls him Iliacus Macer, which implies that
there were two oi the name, and that one ot' them was known as a
compiler of Homeric poems. See Wernsclorff on the Homeristae
Latini in his Poetae Latini Minores.
quin fiet Amori. ‘What will become os Lovel’ Fiet in this
sense is constructed both with (a) the dative, and (b) the ablative:
the former being the dative oi the thing or person affected, ‘what
will huppen to;' the latter being the ablative of the instrument,
‘what will be done by or with? Thus for (a) see Liv. 45. 39 Quid
deinde tam opimae praedae, tom opulentae victoriae spoliis fiet? So
Or. A. A. 1. 5363 sor (b) Cic. Epp. Att. 6.1 Quid illa fiet quem
reliquero? quid meantem si non tone cito decedo?
3. vage, ‘unstable,' ‘uncertain’ So Tib. 2. 3. 39
Praeda vago iussit geminare pericula ponto.
