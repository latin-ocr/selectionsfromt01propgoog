which were commonly placed on the lidos a Roman sarcophagus,
may sometimes have been likenesses oi the deceased; but it is
evident from modern excavations that they were kept ready-made

seems a novel and interesting idea that a man might ‘choose' his
father or mother-though not till after their decease.

34„ ments, his remains, now reduced to ashes3 cp. sup. on 1. aa.

umbra, ol the shade of the laurel bough, in predicatire appo·
sition to quae: translate, ‘to cover with its shade the spot where
lie my lileless remains) 1

35. horrida, of the revolting, loathsome ashes, so out ol
keeping with the idea ol joyous love.

37. notescet mma. The expression is redundant; it was
not the fama ol his sepulchre, but the sepulchre itself, which would
become known. Postgate has some interesting observatione (Introd.
p. lxvii) on Propertius' tendency to what he terms ‘disjunctiveness’
or ‘ polarisation ’ of an idea, by which he charges his meaning donbly,
serving up one idea in two forms, and treating each form as anew
idea. A good example is 3. 1. 17

Sed, quod pace legas, opus hoe de monte sororum
Detulit intacta pagina nostra vim

Here the opus and the pagina are oue and the same thing; yet the
latter is said to bring down the former from the mount ol the Muses.-

38. rutum vrrs, i. e. Achilles.

cruenta, because Polyxena, daughter oi Priam, was sacrificed
by Neoptolemus, his son, upqn his tomb.

39. si qando, denoting an indefinite, though certain, time:
‘when the day comes, whenerer that may be.'

venies ad fata, a euphemism for death: later latin was fond
, ol such soltened modes oi expressing death. See especially in
Tacitus, where such phrases as decessit, excessit, exiit, etc, are con-
stant. Cp. our own phrase ‘ he is gone‚’ or ‘he's away?

For memores cp. Hor. Od. 3. 11. 51

Scalpe querelam,

Ι and4.14.4
Per titulos memoresque fastos.

It is far-letched to suppose that memores anticipates the idea ol the

. next couplet, that his ashes will have some consciousuess of her:

especially as interea, l. 41, marks a new transition.
