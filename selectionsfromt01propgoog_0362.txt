proruamus, 111. 7., 23-28· 295

Propertius is of mythological allusions, he introduces them always
appropriately, so as to heighten, not to interrupt, the feeling ofa
passage; this couplet, if genuine, would be almost a solitary in-
stance in Propertius of lines dragged in inappropriately, for the mere
purpose of parading learning, and thatin a passage of strong feel·
ing where the blemish is all the more apparent. To enter into geo-

graphical details, to drag in Iphigenia, and the Greek lieet, and ,

Aulis, painfully interrupts the feeling of the passage, which is con-
centrated on Paetus and the mode of his death. And the legend
knows of no connection between any youth and the delay of the
Greek fleet. Further, as Mr. Postgate points out, it is clear that
these lines refer to the usual version of the tradition, according to
which Argynnus was drowned in the Cephissus. To connect the
delay at Aulis witha drowning near Mount Mimas is more than

· awkward-it is absurd. Mr. Ellis himself doubts the genuineness

of these lines, and while offering the following paraphrase, acknow·
ledges that the connection is awkwardly indicated: ‘Paetus was
wrecked on the coast, which retains the name of the lost Argynnus,
that youth whom Agamemnon vainly sought to discover, and kept
the fleet at Aulis waiting in the hope of doing so-a delay which
caused the death-of Iphigenia! Can any one believe Propertius
capable of such an irrelevant and pedantic train of thought in the
middle of such a poem as this?

25. Reddita, a vagne address to the powers, whoever they are,
who control the fate of Paetus’ body. Possibly Aquilo and Neptune
(ll. 13, 15) are included. Reddo (see note on 2. 1. 71) implies not
restoration, but a giving of what is due, natural, or expected. All
· kinds of duty therefore are appropriate to the word: here the notion
is that a body is due to the earth, as much as that it is the duty of
friends to bury it. Professor Jebb suggests to me that the words
Reddite, etc. give the key to the whole passage, and that the
word litora 1. ar, with the allusion to the legend of ArgynnuS, is
introduced to add point to the prayer of 1. a 5, that Paetus’ body
may at least be buried. ‘There isa shore near—the shore where
Argynnus was drowned—O waft the body of Paetus to that shore l’

posita est. So N.: much more pointed than H.'s positaque.
As Jacob puts it, ‘ Praedam habetis .· corpus reddite!

26. sponte tua, i. e. as we, his friends, are helpless.

urus, as though he were addressing the nauta of l. 27, not
the sand itself. So Hor. Od. 1. 28. 23.

27. maudoit, as in a. 7. 9‚= praeteribit.

28. umor, as in l. 13, for tinem.
