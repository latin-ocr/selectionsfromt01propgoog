PROPERTIUS, 111. 11.,19-24. 307·

quo ffcitur non ut voluptas ne sit voluptas, sed ut voluptas non sit
summum bonum. Here no distinction canbe drawn between utne
and ut non, each siguifying ⁴ so that 'not’ Our passage is strictly ’
analogous: statuit urbem ut tolleret opus ct ut currus ne possent
stringere latus. This use of ne as = non in consecutive propositions
suggests that ne might similarly be used after utin final propositione,
iu which case ut m would mean ‘in order that not ’'and thus be =
ne alone. This supposition at once explains the difficolt passage, -
Hor. Sat. 2. 1. 37, iu vain tortured by commentator's:

Missus ad hoc pulsis, octus est ut fama, Sabellis,

Quo no per vacuum 'Romano incurreret hortis.

Ne here simply stands for the negative after ut final, and quo ne
is = ne, ‘in order that not.’ The whole difficulty is thus removed ;
and Palmer’s ingenious but unnatural explanation, connecting quo
with vacuum, ‘unguarded of whom,' rendered unnecessary. Bentley
quotes the Digest ar. r. 17. 5 in illustration of quo ne: si celandi
causa, quo no ad dominum reverteretur, fugisset. But the authority
is late, and the interpretation doubtful: Schiitz punctuates si celandi
causa quo, nr ad dominum reverteretur, fugisset. More to the point
is Cic. Fam. 7. a praefinisti quo nc pluris emerem. Palmer says of “
this passage, ‘It is obvious that quo is govemed by pluris) Troe:
bnt quo contains either a final or consecutive meaning=ut eo, and
therefore no is used, not non. So exactly in Liv. 346 quoted by
Roby: cautum erat quo m plus auri et argentifacti, quo ne plus
signati auri etaeris domi haberemus. Here quo is doubtless governed
by plus3 bnt quo utplus is the exact equivalent of ut eo m plus or
ut ne plus eo, and exactly illustrares the point insisted on. Another
illustration is Hor. Sat. 1. r. 40 '

Nil obstet titi dum ne sit te ditior alter,

where nt does not mean ‘lest,' ‘in order that not‚’ but is simply
used for non after dum in the sense of {provided that,’ to which
meaning, asindicating purpose, non would not be appropriate. The
rule might perhaps be formulated in this way: ‘After ut, signifying
consequence, ne may be used; after ut, or any similar conjunctim,
denoting purpose, no must be used, in place of non! Bohn (trans.
p. 90 note) quotes three cases of ne forut non in consecutive clauses,
bnt none of these are consecutive clauses. They are substantiva!
clauses only.

The noc of N. is obviously a correction by one who did not un-
derstand the construction. But for the Et of l. ²3 nec would have
been the proper word to use.

annuere, ‘to graze ι’ its proper meaning is ‘to grasp tightly:
