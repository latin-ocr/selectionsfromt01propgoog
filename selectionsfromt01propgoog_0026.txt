Now the T m'stia were written fully thirty years after the

death of Tibullus, and it is extremely improbable that
Ovid would have horrowed so remarkable a line without
acknowledgment, or, if he did so, have failed to notice a
coincidence so remarkable between his own life and that
of Tibullus.

(a) But it is‘ no less improbable that Tibullus was
born so late as B. c. 43. ln Β. c, 31 we find him declining
an invitation to follow his patron Messalla to the cam·
paign which ended in the battle of Aetium ; whilst in the
year following he took part in his Aquitanian campaign.
To suppose that he was only twelve and thirteen years
old respectively on these two occasions is out of the
question. ’ ,

(3) Ovid himself, Trist. 4. 10. 51-54-a passage which
we shall consider further in treating of the life of Propertius
-states distinctly that disparity of ag'e had prevented him
from enjoying the friendship of Tibullus. This remark
he further clenches in the next two lines: for arranging
the ¹four elegiae poets of his own age in chronological
order, he puts Gallus first, Tibullus next, and then declares
that Propertius was successorto Tibullus, while he himself
was successor to Propertius. Now Gallus was born in
Β. c. 66, and Propertius somewhere between the years 5ο
and 47 B. c. (see Introduction to Propertius). It is there· ⁴
fore impossible that Tibullus can have been born so
lateas Β. c. 43, 'and we must look for some date between
Β. c. 66 on the one hand, and Β. e. 50, or at the latest s
Β. c. 47, on the other.

What other clue have we to guide us toa more precise
date? We have seen that Domitius Marsus says he was
a youth (iuvenem) at the tirne of his death in Β. e. 19 or
B.c. 18: so too says the Biography, while the Life attri-
buted to Hieronymus Alexandrinus, and which is, in fact,
the same biography expanded, declares that he died in flore
iuventutis. The terrn iuvenis was, however, used techni·
