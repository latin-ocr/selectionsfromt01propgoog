Medus infestus sibi ldctuosis

where the force of the line is intensifred by the fact that sibi may be
taken, and is intended to be taken, with all the three words—in-
festus, luctuosis, Dissidet.

67. Appears to imply that her daughter was born in the year
of her father's censorship. On what authority does Postgate take
specimen to he ‘ a mirrori’ It rather meansa sample, by which a thing
may be seen or known: so Plaut. Most. 1. a. 51 os au illustration‚

Tum specinsen cernitur quo eveniat aedificatio.

69. sorte, i. e. by carrying ou the line unbroken.

motta. Each son was a ‘prop' to the house: see Postgate's
illustrations.

70. The MS. readings uncturis or nupturis, and malis, are
clearly out of place: but I cannot see that Postgate's facta is au im·
provement. Mea fata is quite a Propertian expression, used widely
to denote her lot and position as a whole, including not only her
death (·-·me nrcrtuam, Schultze), but her life, her family, and all
the circumstances of honour which she has just enumerated. ‘I set
forth in Charon's bark without regret, knowing that my own (ie.
children or family) will add yet more to my many titles to dis-
tinction.’ It is surely inappropriate for a Roman metron to boast

⁸ of her many dccdr: but not of the many elements of honour with
which fate had surrounded her. For augere factu iu this sense
Postgate compares Tib. 1. 7. 55

quaefacta parentis Augeat:

but the facta, in that passage, are the exploits of a Messala.
Another interpretation, however, may be suggested. Tot may be
taken with meis: she is addressing her children, and has just ex-
horted them to continue the race, Et serie fulcite genus. She may
well add, ‘I die willingly, leaving so many children behind me
who will add fresh lustre to my name and life.’ Nor would it be
impossible for fata here to mean ‘death,' aselsewheret ‘my children
will add fresh glory to my death,' i. e. ‘to me aster I am dead and
goue,’ ‘to me even atter death,’ -

¹71. extem, ‘the highest, crowning reward?

72. emensum rogum, ‘the pyre of one who has served her (or
his)time.’ Emm'tum doesnot of itself necessarily conveypraise: this
is done hy laudat. The highest honour a woman can attain is that,
having lived her full time, she should receive praise at her death.
