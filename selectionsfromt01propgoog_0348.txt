The car oi Caesar laden with spoils would be the central and most
important spectacle of the triumph: to make the poet relegate that

suggests exuvias on the ground that spectare needs an object. No
criticism could be less sound: spectare is used technically and

as wearers oi breeches; hence further Gaul was sometimes called
Braccata, Juv. 8. 234. Caecina affected the Gallie dress, wearing
a tartan plaid as well as breeches, bracas barbarum tegmen indutias

the ancient Southron was shocked' because the Celt wore trousers,
while the modern Sonthron affecte to beno less shocked because
he dispenses with them. The latter probably iorgets that the kilt
was a Roman military dress, worn by the Caesars: see the famous
