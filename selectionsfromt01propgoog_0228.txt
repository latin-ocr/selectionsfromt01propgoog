TIBULLUS, Η. 2.,’26-58. 161

34. 1222222212. Varro, R. R. 2. 11. 10, says shaving was in·
troduced into Rome from Sicily Β. c. 3003 while Pliny, H. N. 7. 59,
attributes the ‘daily shave’ to Scipio Africanus. Thus intonsus,
barbatus, incomptus are standing epithets oi 'the ancieuts:' ol a
bold and tr'uthsul witness Jnv. 16. 31 says,

Et credam dignum barba dignumque capillis
Majarum.

38. Cp. Virg Geo.1. 8
Liberat alma Ceres, urstra si munere tellus
Chaoniam paugui glandem mutauit arista.

44. intima, in a transitive sense, ‘watering,’ as in Virg
Geo, 32

43 Irriguumque bibant malano fouum;
¹ mapassrve sense ‘well- watered' inHor Sat. 2. 4. 16

Irriguo nihil cst elutius hortm
figuratively 1d 2. 1. 9 '
Irriguumque mero suh noctem carpus habenta.
46. aecurua=siru cura, ‘without care or anxiety3’ here ‘that
knows no care‚’ or possibly ‘care-dispelling.'
48. nononis, ‘surrende1s.' Cp. Prop. a.19.1a vitem docta
ι paurefalce comas. 'consu oi the harvest. annua, ‘year by year.¹
49. verno goes here with alvea, as with stare in l. 59, not with
rure in either line.
51. satiatus, ‘having had enough os!
. 5542112222 is here equivalent to inductus. The word is
' usually applied to a flnsh or a paleness under the skin, as Ov. Am. 3.
3.5, Fast. 1. ²¹53 here to something laid over it. Lucr. 6. 479 says
of the clouds

huffuuduutque sua caelum caligam
but that rather suggests the idea that the clouds form a lining to the
sky as looked at stom outside its sphere. For the use osred paint,
not only sor painting the faces oi the gods, bnt also those of the
worshippers, see above on 1. 1. 17.
56. ab is not redundant. it denotes the beginning ‘ from which?
55, 56. For these early rustic performauces see Hor. Ep. 2. 1.
139-155 and Virg. Geo. 2. 385-396. ,
58. This line is corrupt, bnt parcas or curtas seems a certain
correction. The best MS. reading is
Dux pecan‘s hircus auxerat hircus oues,
which is unmeaning, besides the metrical difficulties involved. The
meaning seems to be that the agricola was enriched by receiving
a hircus as a prize.
