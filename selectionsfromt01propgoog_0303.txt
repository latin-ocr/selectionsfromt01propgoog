236 mores,

Hic bellum lacrimosum, lic miseram samem
Pestemque a papula et principe Caesare in
Persas atque Britannos
.Vestra matus aget prece.

17. ΕΙ que. for si aliqua, ‘if there be any that’ would be quite
indefinite, but that the indicative subtrahit shows that a particular
country is meant. So Virg. Aen. 7. ²²5·

ee subtrahit. Our proudinsular isolation hes perhaps never
been more simply and finely expressed.

19. Eaac caetra eequu, i.e‚ ‘this is the cause to whichl
= shall attach myself asa poet,' referring to bella canam 1. 8. He will
follow the conquering course in spirit. There is no idea of his
actually accompanying the expedition as an official poet, counterpart
of the modern War Correspondent, as Paley seems to suggest.
Ovid has an exact parallel, Am 218. 11, 12: his love is ever
enticing him from singing deeds of war:

Frangar, et ingenium sumptis revocatur ab armis,
Resque domi gestas et mea bella cana. ¹

20. huno. This use of leunc Postgate well illustrates from
Tib. 1. 3. 93, Ov. Pout. 1. 4. 57. Propertius uses ille in exactly
the same connection, 3. 1. 36
. Illum past ce'rures augurer ipse diem.

’ 21. in mente elme, lit. ‘in the case of tall statues‚‘ or as
we should say ‘of a tall statue? For this use of in, used to localise
or specify, cp. Hor. Epod. 11. 4

Amare, qui me praeter omrees expetit
Mollibus in pueris aut in puellis urere.

22. hio, further defined by ante pedes: ‘just here, before my
feet,’ as though he were pointing to the very spot. So 1.19. 7,
quoted by Postgate, where illic is explained by caecis lacis.

23. inopen conscendere. Another instance of Horace’s
favourite Graecism Conscendere carmen laudes, ‘To climb up to
the height of a song of praise' is an intelligible and graphio ex-
pression, expressing both the difficulty of the task in itself, and the
grandeur of the merit that calls for such an effort. Itis scarcely
necessary to assume that laudis means ‘thy merit' in particulam
or that there is a frigid reference to the stock phrase of climbing
the hill of the Muses.

24. The figure is slightly changed here3 instead ofcrowning
a statue in honour of a victory, the poet represents himself as
offering a humble offering at the festival of a god. The idea of
vilia tura is exactly illustrated by Horace in his beautiful address
