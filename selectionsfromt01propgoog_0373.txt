with the monument of king Alyattes by Herod. 1. 93. To what the
¹word tincta refers is not known.

The next figure iu Propertius’ gallery is Semiramis, the sabulous
queen of Nineveh, daughter of a Syrian goddess, and wife of Ninus,
whose favour she won by her skill in taking Bactra. After her hus·
band’s death she ruled long alone; conquered many antinus, including
Egypt; built Babylon, with its famous walls of brick; erected in
¹ Nineveh a monument to her husband a mile high; and did many
other marvellous things.

21. The terms Persians, iliades, and Parthians, are used rn-
drfferently by the Augustan writers In Od. a. aHorace speaks of
the Parthians first as Persians, l. aa, and a few lines further on as
Medes. Cp. Luc. 6. 446 Babylon Persea.

Paley and Pinder both suppose Propertius’ meaning to be that
these great works, carried out by women, would never have been
achieved by their husbands alone. There is no indication, of any
such comparison in the text. All that Propertius does is to indicate
instances of female greatness.

this ‘ an incorrect usage? so also Pinder, while Palmer' preserves the
nec of N. and adopts mitti, the tempting conjecture of R. Y. Tyrrell
for missi in l. 23. But all these editors have failed to see the true
construction. Samiramis is the main subject of the whole passage,
down to 1. 26: statuit in 1. ar being continued by Brixia condidit l.
25, and Iussit 1. 26. The whole three lines, rra—24, are subordinate
to statuit, and ne, 1. 24, is subordinate to nt l. aa. The whole
passage reads literally thus: ‘Semiramis built Babylon in such a
way that she reared walls of brick, and that two chariots facing each
other could not (i. e. needed not to) graze their sides in consequence
of their axles touching.' Ne does not stand for nt non, but only sor
non after the preceding ut of consequence. Cp. Cic. Fin. a. 8 Ex
