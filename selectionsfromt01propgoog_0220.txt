TIBULLUS, 1. 10, ¹¹·27· 153

unsarana So a. 2. aa addressing the Genz'm' Natalis,

18. veteris seems here used almost as = senis, There is

gone by. ,

23. voti compos. Votum is properly ‘a vow :’ i. e. a prayer
accompanied bya promise that if the thing prayed for be granted,
’ , some offering or service shall be given in return for it. Being thus
a promise accompanied by a condition, the word is used sometimes
specially ol the promise, sometimes specially of the condition. Thus
voti conrpos means ‘having gained or become possessed of the thing
prayed for;' voti reus, voti damnatus, mean ‘having become bound
to fulfil the promise,' i. e. in consequence of having obtained the
prayer. In both cases the seme fact is stated, only from a different

point of vicu.

able to secure his safety.
, ausura is read by good MSS. and is a saser reading than mys-
tica. On the other hand, it was less likely to be changed to mystica
than vice versa: and mystica derives confirmation from χοιρία μοσ-
τηρικά, χοίρους μυστηρικάς Arist. Ach. 747, 764, in connection with
the worship ol Ceres. So Virg. hes mystica vannus Iacchi, and Tib.
