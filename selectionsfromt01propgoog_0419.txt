36. farao. Ihave adopted Palmer’s conjecture. Lyrae must
surely be wrong. The expressioh is very harsh, and un-Properttan in
itself, and if it were possible to strain lyrae so as to make it equivalent
to Musae, the answer is that there was no tradition of the Muses having
been alarmed by the Python. Imbelles lyrae has crept in because, of
inerme lyrae of l. 32, and fere might easily drop out after the uere
of timuere. As Apollo himself was the chief lyrist, the poet would
scarcely have represented the lyre especially as quailing before the
Python. This objectlon is not' removed by supposing lyrae=Musaa
Still we must not forget Hor. Od. 1. 6. ro

Imbcllisque lyrae Musa potens vehat. ·
37. muudi, emphatic, as in l. 19. At Actium the fate of the

· whole civilised world was to be decided ; just as Rome, in the person

of Augustus, was to be suffered to reach
Quicunque mundo terminus obstitit,
Hor. Od. 3. 3. 53.

39. lam terre tua eat. not strictly true. Augustus had as yet
nowhere defeated Antony by land: and had Antony not followed the
ill-started advice of Cleopatra to decide the event on the sea, he had
a splendid army of 1oo,ooo trained legionaries to bring into the field,
besides countless auxiliarius. Antony is generally represented as
having staked his last chanoe at Actium3 but it would be no less
true to say the same of Augustus: and had Antony won, his courtly
poets might well have represented Apollo as saying to him before
the battle, iam terra tua est.

modern expression? Postgate.

44. nou bane, ie. the omen was a disastrous one, after all.
All Rome and her career has been founded on a delusion.

45. leuuca, an almost certain correction for Latinis, which is
Ι due to remis. Fluctus needs an epithet: the scandal was that a
royal fleet should venture into Latin waters; aud that too when
. Augustus was princeps. (Apollo commitsan anachronism here, as
Augustus was not made princeps senatus till Β. e. 28.) Et nimium
remis is not ‘And so ’ (Postgate) : nothing yet has been said to dis-
parage Antony's fleet. The words refer to what precedes from l. 39,
Vince mari: iam terra tua est, etc. The land is already yours:
yon must save your country now by victory at sea. ‘Ay, and their
confidence in their ships is over-great' comes in quite naturally, fol-
¹ lowed by indignation that they should have been permitted to
approach at att.
