,⁶ the unconscionable goose l' ‘Unconscionable‘ is a word used in a
humorous bantering way, of a thing to which we apply moral con·
demnation, but at the same time indicate we do not do so seriously.
Thus ⁶ unconscionable' exactly hits off the meaning of Martial. when
he says of his country habits
Ingenti fmor improboque sonrno.

It is quite out of place here where the epithet is serionsly applied.
See note on improbus r. 1. 6. ’

26. Cerberus' chain is to hang loose: no bar is to be drawn in
the gate which he is guarding.

27. loquor. The MS. reading is more impressive and stately
than loquar. Cornelia here begins a speech which lasts to the end

the fortunes of Pompey throughout the civil war, and commanded
the Pompeian fleet off Brundusium before Pharsalia. His daughter
was married to Sextus Pompey: and in B.c. 40 he was an important

exaequat is not, as Postgate says, used absolutely, bnt transi·
