PROPERTJUS,111. 7., 1-7. 289

head-water or source oi a stream, and caput can doubtless be used in
such a sense, in a proper connection: but to address Money with
‘The secds oi care take their rise from your Jbuutaiuluad ’ would be
a little too harsh even for Propertius. Postgate supports this inter·
pretation bysontis eaput from 3. 19. 63 but theswhole line reads .
Fluminaque adsontis sint redituro eaput,
which is a periectly natural expression, involving no harshness or
confusion.

de eapite tao=de te: see above note on 2. 1. 36.

5. tendentem in this phrase has the sense oi ‘stretching,' not ⁸
os direction. The phrase is equivalent to ‘in full sail,’ implying a
prosperous course: ‘all well!

rhsrtos portus, i. e. Alexandria. See notes on Tib. 1. 3. 32, ¹
Prop. 2. r. 30. ’

6. hanno. Cp. Hor. Od. 3. 4 30 imanienlis Bospori, imaue
Caprae sidera id. 3. 7. 6, imani Leucis id. 1. 16. 15, and insanis
aquis Ov. Her. 1. 6.

terque quaterque. A hyperbolical way of expressing the
terrific nature of the storin: cp. Tib. 3. 3. 26

0 mili felicem terque quaterque diem!
So felices ter et amplius Hor. Od. 1. 3. 17 and bis terque mutatae ’
dapis Ep. 5. 33. Possibly here successive waves are meant.

7. exotdtt has no special reference to shipwreck. The word
simply means ‘to fall out oi :' as when Cicero says verdum tibi nou
fortuito excidit Phil. 10. 2, ‘did not escape you ;' or oi forgetfulness,
at mihi isto exciderant, ‘had escaped my memory,'Leg. a. 18. 46.
Here Paetus is said to bave ‘fallen out os' that which he lost or
from which he disappeared‚ viz. his lise. So above 3. 2. ²5 noncen
ab aevo Excidet. Still more carious is Ter. And. a. 5. 12 uxore ex·
cidit, ‘fell out of‚¹ i. e. ‘lost the chance of getting,' a wife. (We say,
in a different sense, a mansell out witlc his wife.)

The juxtaposition of noou to longinquis doubles the soree of the
idea, each side oi the relation being stated separately. The fishes
were distant to him; be was strange (nova) to the hahes. The
principle is the same as that involved in such juxtapositions as
Hor. Epod. 1. 21 ut adsit . . . praesentibus, Plaut. Most. 1. 1. 27

Adsum praesens praesenti tibi,
Hor. Sat. 2. 6. 81
fertur
Accepisse cavo veterem vetus hospes amicum
or more subtly, Od. 2. 4. 6· where captivae and domiuum repeat the
semidea,
