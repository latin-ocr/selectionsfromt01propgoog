TIBULLUS,1.1.‚1-4. ¹ , 107

Nec tantan inaim pectus mihi carpitur aura,
Nec bibit egemma divite nostra sitis ,·
' Nec milui mille iugis Campania pinguis aratur,
ι Nec miser aera paraclade, Curiatiae, tua.

of wealth, fulvo auro is one of the means by which it may be ecch,
mulated. The two main forms are distinguished, Hor. Sat. 2. 1. 13
Dives agn's, dives positis insanare nummis.
2. teneat, ‘have and hold? The word avoids all awkward ques-
tions as to how possession is to be obtained.

omer, ‘land fully tilled,’ and therefore necessarily gained by
expropriation.

multa, A. has magna: asimilar mistake occurs Ov. Am.3. 15. 12
where P. (Palatinus primus) reads campi iugera parva for pauca.
But Hor. sati 1. 6. 4 has magnis legionibus ,· so Sallust, Cat. 53.
Iugera aaagna might therefore κ ‘whole aeres.' The Roman
iugerum contained two actus quadrati, and the actus quadratuswas
a square whose side was one hundred Roman feet. Hence a:
iugerum = a· rectangular plot of ground 240 feet by 120. The
English acre represents a square whose sides are nearly ²09 feet, and*-
contains 43,56o square feet. By reducing Roman feet to English
(the Roman foot equals about 11·64 inches imperial measure), it
Ι will be found that the Roman iugerum contained 27,097 square
feet, and so was less than two-thirds of the English acre.

Theline is obviously imitated by Ov. Fast. 3. 192
Iugeraqua inculti pauca tenere sali.

3. labor auduus, here used of the hardships and dangers
of a soldier's life. So Caesar B. G. 7. 41 ofan attack on his camp
nostras assidua labore defatigarent. Hor. Epod. 1. 15 alluding (as ‘
here Tibull.) to the Actian campaign

Rogas tuum laborem quid iuvem ineo?
So Soph. Phil. 864
πόνος ὁ μὴ φοβῶν κράτιστος. ,

Quem . . . terreat, the tubj. because no individual is pointed,
at in alius l. 1. Quem has thus a consecutive force‚=‘one of such*
⁴ a kind as?

4. mantea. The history of the word classicam is remarkable:
It is here used to denote ‘a trumpet,’ as in Virg. Geo. 2. 539

ll'ecdum ettam audierant inflari classica.
Its proper meaning is ‘a military signal? a signal given to the
‘Classes’ into which the Roman people were divided for military
purposes by the constitution of Servius Tullius. The word classr's
