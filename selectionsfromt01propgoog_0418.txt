PROPERTIUS‚ IV. 6., 23:35. 351

ter simply indicates there were several waves or caris in the

fies this faa with the Iulium sidus.

in oolla solutos, ‘flowing in disorder 00 to his neck!
32. 1000000, i.e. he had come as the god 01 battle, as ‘lord oi

33. ‘But (he appeared) with snchalook as that with which: etc:
i. e. quali—vultu has a double construction: it is both an ablative 01
quality attached 10 Apollo as he appeared at Actium, and ¹an
ablativa 01 the instrument in connection with adspexit. The allusion
01 course is to' the description 01 Apollo when he smote the Greeks
with pestilence in his wrath against Agamemnon ior refusing the
suit 01 Chryses, Iliad 1. 48 seqq.
βῆ δὲ κατ’ Οὐλύμποιο καρήνων χωόμενος κῆρ,
τόξ’ ὤμοισιν έχων ἀμφηρεφέα xee φαρέτρην·
ἔκλαγξαν δ’ ἄρ’ ὀϊστοὶ ἐπ’ ὦμον χωομένοιο,
αὐτοῦ κινηθέντος· ὁ δ’ ἤϊε νυκτὶ ἐοικώς.
34. egessit. Egerere properly ‘to carry forth,' used here as

equivalent to efferre, as in Pers. 5. 69
ecce aliud cras

Egerit hos annos,

‘carries forth to burial! The expression, however, is confused by
making castra the object instead 01 the bodies, whilst rogis does not
suggest 01 itseli the funeral procession. It is not necessary to suppose
that egerere means ‘to empty,’ either here, or in Stat. Theb. 1. 37
egestas altemis mortibus urbes. The literal translation is intelligible
enough: ‘carried forth (to hunul), i. e. consumed, the Greek camp
by the greedy funeral pyres.' So in the passage from Statius, ‘whole
cities taken out to burial by.’

35. solvit, 01 the muscles relaxed in death. As Postgate says
(see his note 00 passage), per orbes goes equally with solvit and ser-
pentem, which is here the participle. It means ‘coil by coil,' justas
explicuit per membra virum quoted by Postgate from Luc. 4. 629
means ‘limb by limb’ Per gives the idea 01 successive stages
