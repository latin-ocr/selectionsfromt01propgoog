' 21. mon. The metaphor is from the laps of the racc-course.
to which evecta is strictly applicable. So orbem 3. 1. 39.

22. I. e. ‘you must not swamp your bark by over-freighting it.'
The comparison oi a poet’s craft to a ship is common: cp. inf.
3 9 4Νοη sunt opto meae grandia vela rati,

aud ib. l. 35

Non ego velzfcra tumidum marc findo carino.

24. turba, ‘confusion' ‘trouble' Turba and turbare are
constantly used by Plautus in the sense of to ‘work confusion,' ⁸ make
mischiei’ as of the mystifications os Tranio in the Mostellaria. T urbo
and turbidus are also frequently used of storms or foul weather: cp.
Attius ap. Non. 524. 26

Non vides quam turbam quosve fluctus concites?

26. Palmer, following N., reads quo.
nova semite. Cp. intacto vio 3. 1. 18.
27. He describes one os the artificial grottoes spoken of above
3.2.12. -

28. tympana, ‘tambourines :' the special instrument¹ of Cybele
and of Bacchanalian worship. ι

29. Ergo Musarum. So the MSS. Hertz. explains ergo es
having its original meaning = ἔργῳ, ‘in very'iact.' He quotes Hor.
Sat. a. 6. 70, where ergo cannot mean ‘therefore' but rather ‘so
then,’ or else ‘after that! The latter meaning is not appropriate: if
ergo be retained it can only mean ⁴ und so‚’ ‘well,' ‘to proceed.’ ‘ and
then ' (= Gk. δή), implying that the appearance of the cave naturally
led up to the idea that it was a haunt os the Muses, adorned with
their emblems. Hertz. suggests organa as au alternative; Haupt
orgzo, while Miiller conjectures orgiaffmustarum (mystaruml). The
sing. imago oi the images oi the Muses and Silenus allords a further
objection to the MS. reading. The connection between Bacchus aud
the Muses is constant. Cp. a. 30. 37-8

Hic ubi me prima statuent in parte choreae,
Et nzedius docta cuspide Bacchus en‘t.
In 4. 6. 75-6 we have the connection in a grosser form:
Ingenium potis irritet Mum poetis,
Bacche, soles Phoebo fertilis esse tuo,

reminding us of the dictum os Cratinus os given by Hor. Ep. 1. 19. π’

Nulla placere diu nec vivere (ormino posmnt
Quae scribuntur aquae potoribus,
