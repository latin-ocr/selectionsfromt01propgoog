TO TIBULLUS. xxv -

them that it is hard to believe they can be the work of
an unknown poet. Some suppose them to have been
written by Sulpicia herself, daughter or granddaughter of
Cicero's contemporary, the famous jurist Servius Sulpicius,

Ι who was consul nc. 51.

The first six elegies of the First Book are addressed
to Delia-'whose real name would seem to have been
Plancio, Plantz'a, or Plania (Apuleius, Apol. 10)—for
whom the poet had formed the most ¹ardent and faithful
attachment. Throughout the whole of this Book, the
dream of his life is to retire with her to his country
property, and to pass the rest of his days in the
enjoyment of her love, and of the simple pleasures of
country life. He nursed her tenderly during an illness
which occurred after his return from Corcyra, but not
long afterwards she threw him over, and united herself to
another and richer lover. The Second Book is devoted
mainly to another charmer of the name of Nemesis, of

, whom it is probable that Horace speaks under the name
of Glycera, Od. 1. 33. Ovid, at any rate, in his beautiful
elegy upon the poet's death, knows only of his having had
two loves, Am. 3. 9. 31, 32
Sic Nemesis longum, sic Delia nomen habebunt,
Altera cura recem, altera primur amor.

‘So will Nemesis, so will Delia, have an everlasting
name: the last his first, the first his latter love'

While in line 58 he tells us how both Delia and Nemesis
were beside his sick bed, along with his mother and his
sister, and that the latter claimed to have held his hand
in death:

Me tenuit moriens deficiente manu.

‘He held me as he died with his failing hand!
A charming picture of the character and person of
