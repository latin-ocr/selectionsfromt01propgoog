this country, not a century ago, were mobbed in the streete. No
less indignant is Horace, Epod. 9. 16

Sol aspicit canapium.
Hence our ‘canopy’ κώνωψ is ‘a gnat.’

46. iura dare, ‘to legislate: ‘rule’ The statement of this
line appears to have been literally hue: for Dion 50. 5 says that
Cleopatra actually τῶν Ῥωμαίων ἄρχειν ἐλπίσαι, τήν τε εὐχὴν τὴν
μεγίστην ὁπότε τι dardos ποιεῖσθαι, τὸ ὲν τῷ Καπιτωλίῳ δικάσω.
Doubtless Horace refers to this Od. 1. 37. 6

et statuas iuter et arma Bari. Hertz. gravely insists that
statuas must not be connected with Mari, because there were no
statues of men in the Capitol (except those os the kings and oi
Brutus) before the time of Caesar. But his history is as much at
fault as his Latin. It would be impossible to separate statuas
from Mari: and, as a matter oi fact, ὼε reference is to the noto· .

ae. 65.Ι Sulla had passed a law forbidding Marius’ bust to be
displayed, or any monument to be put up in his honour. Caesar
had already dared (Β. c. 68) to violate this law by having the image
of Marius paraded at the funeral of his widow Julia‚ Caesar’s aunt.
He now outraged senatorial Rome, and delighted the mob, by
causing the statues of Marius, with the trophies representing his
Jugurthine and Cimbric triumphs, to be replaced secretly by night
in the Capitol, Suet. Jul.11; Vell. 2. 43 ; Val. Max. 6. 9. 4.

Palmer conjectures ᾱατοι, with a point of exclamation at
the end of the line. In this case ausa, l. 41, is a participle, not the
verb, and the whole passage, 39—46, reads as one sentence. Buta
long passage oi this kind, reserving its one principal verb for eight
lines, is scarcely after the manner of Propertius.
